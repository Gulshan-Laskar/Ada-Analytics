NGD,wallstreetbets,"Gold sector internals update for Wednesday, August 21st 2024  $$$  Market breadth healthy and still in stealth mode  $$$  Maximum contrarian","Since the Yen carry trade bottom GDX and XLK are neck and neck and highly correlated.  However YTD GDX is edging out XLK.  The dollar index is weakening in the face of treasury oversupply and macro geo political developments.  Interest rates are falling across the yield curve in anticipation of imminent rate cuts (as well as steepening).  These high rates are costing the US govt a trillion in annual carrying cost on the 35T of debt.  It appears that gold is pricing this in.  I expect gold to catch a bid the day they actually do cut rates as it will be safer for institutions to take long positions in gold.  And will need to price in subsequent rate cuts going into 2025 and 2026.  

The US Treasury Dept claims to have 261mm ounces of gold.  at $2,500 this gives the United States a gold reserve worth \~650 billion.  Thus at current gold prices the debt (35T) has 1.8% gold backing.  That's not going to cut it in my humble opinion.  For this gold position of theirs to be valued at one trillion gold would need to be about $3,800.  And even then it would represent less than 3% of the national debt.  

GDX continues to pull away from spot gold price performance YTD.  About time.  GDX and SILJ calls that were in the money at the point in time I have the below chart normalized to are performing excellent.  The 2026 calls as well.  The breadth in the gold mining stock market is strong.  Many GDX components have doubled since the end of February precious metals wash out lows.

To recap the precious metals developments of 2024 this is the score card.  Gold closed above $2,100 for the first time in the final days of February.  The precious metals sector took off in unison at that time.  Silver made a 2 year 9 month high and two weeks later followed up with an 11 year high.  Silver out performed gold mightily until recently.  I expect another round of silver out performance.  The mining sector really rips hard when the Silver to Gold ratio is declining.  It recently touched 90:1 and is still in the 80s.  So this is optimal entry point.  However if we go into a recession silver might not participate.  But the emerging markets could pick up the slack for silver demand as they grow and their currencies out perform the dollar. 

 I normalize my charts to February 28th to see how much the individual components are beating spot gold and here are the results.  Returns since the cherry picked lows.  

* CDE Coeur +170%
* GOLD Barrick Gold +44%
* WPM Wheaton Precious Metals +56%
* NGD New Gold 126%
* HMY Harmony Gold +103%
* KGC Kinross Gold Corp +95%
* NEM Newmont +74%
* AEM Agnico Eagle +72%
* AU Anglo Gold Ashanti +80%
* HL Hecla +80%
* IAG I Am Gold +105%
* RGLD Royal Gold +40%
* TORX Torex Gold +90%
* MAG MAG Silver +67%
* SA Seabridge Gold +67%

Many of these tickers are making 52 week highs or multi year highs.  There are many more than these that are beating gold but these are senior GDX components. 

Spot gold is up less than 25% in that same period.  So someone is positioning in the gold sector.  My guess is contrarian hedge funds and institutional investors that are front running an easing cycle and the second incoming wave of inflation.  It could be GDX itself but there is no significant inflows that would support this kind of buying, I don't think their AUM has budged.  GDX has no towering volume bars on any chart time frame.   

Micheal Lynch on substack is a Comex precious metals analyst and his work is excellent.  He wrote the other day that the physical gold settlement market is coming under heavy pressure.  Something to consider.  There is no honor among thieves and when central banks need to defend their currencies they will need to increase their gold reserves and as we have seen this year gold has been bid the entire time.  It hasn't given back any of its gains (yet).  And gold grades across the globe are declining as well as annual prodcution.  

I'm concentrating in GDX and SILJ leaps and two senior large cap producers also with leaps.  no shares outside of a few high conviction trades on tickers that do not have options available.  

Good luck out there.  Stay tuned.

NGD,stocks,My Stocks To Buy 12/28/2020,"I use the 180D/4H Chart. I also use RSI, Stochastic, Vortex Indicator, and 10-50-200 EMA Lines.

&#x200B;

$DHI: Such a beautiful ascending triangle play. Also a support area which is awesome. Needs to break EMA lines to show real strength, and Stoch showing divergence, and VI is low

&#x200B;

$ENBL: Rebound play, as it has bounced here before. Just needs to break the 50EMA line, and the 200EMA is your support area. Stoch is low, RSI was oversold, and VI is low

&#x200B;

$ERIC: Expensive, but perfect ascending triangle play. Once it breaks EMA lines it is will be massive. Indicators say it has room to drop still, which is fine. Could be a big move

&#x200B;

$GFF: Another beautiful ascending triangle play. At support, but indicators say it may pull back but price action is what is important for this one.

&#x200B;

$KTRA: Great penny stock channel. Once it breaks the 50 and 200EMA lines, it'll go crazy. Showing higher lows as well, RSI fair price. Great setup.

&#x200B;

$LULU: Another beautiful ascending triangle. All Indicators say it is a great deal, and it is holding above the 200EMA. Has room to drop still, but eventually -- this will be big

&#x200B;

$NGD: Simple channel up, and now a 50EMA bounce play. Stoch just reversed, RSI fair, and Vortex says good deal.

$NIU: New channel play here, very good value. All indicators say it is a great value play here, and just needs to break EMA lines. 

&#x200B;

$SPT: Resistance now being tested as a support; 50EMA bounce play. May drop to the channel up area, which is fine -- but for now the Stoch says it is gearing up for a move here.

&#x200B;

$TAST: Channel that has higher lows over months now. Hanging above 200EMA which is great, and this channel is very strong. If it dies buy into the triangle channel and then go long.

&#x200B;

$TNX: Fantastic deal here. Ascending Triangle, at support, if this breaks up gonna be fantastic.

$TRIL: Fantastic deal on a channel play here. Higher lows, and just has to hold above the 50EMA line. Indicators say it is tired, so it may pull back, but it is a great setup.

* U.S. stock futures were higher this morning, possibly extending a streak that has seen the S&P 500 and Nasdaq rise for the past four sessions and the Dow gain for the past two days. The Dow and Nasdaq are on track to post an 8th straight weekly gain. (CNBC)
* Cramer: There's a looming threat for the stock market and it has nothing to do with China (CNBC)
* The first cryptocurrency created by a major U.S. bank is here – and it's from J.P. Morgan (JPM). Engineers at the lender have created the 'JPM Coin,' a digital token that will be used to instantly settle transactions between clients of its wholesale payments business. (CNBC)
* Dow component Coca-Cola (KO) reports its fourth quarter earningsthis morning before the opening bell. After-the-bell earnings reports today include Applied Materials (AMAT), Canopy Growth (CGC), CBS (CBS), Chemours (CC), Nvidia (NVDA), and Redfin (RDFN). (CNBC)

* Congress today aimed to end a dispute over border security, and avoid another government shutdown, with legislation that includes nearly $1.4 billion for new physical barriers but not a concrete wall. A stalemate in December over President Donald Trump's request for $5.7 billion to help build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border led to a record-long government shutdown. (Reuters)

* U.S. stock futures were higher this morning, possibly extending a streak that has seen the S&P 500 and Nasdaq rise for the past four sessions and the Dow gain for the past two days. The Dow and Nasdaq are on track to post an 8th straight weekly gain. (CNBC)
* Cramer: There's a looming threat for the stock market and it has nothing to do with China (CNBC)
* The first cryptocurrency created by a major U.S. bank is here – and it's from J.P. Morgan (JPM). Engineers at the lender have created the 'JPM Coin,' a digital token that will be used to instantly settle transactions between clients of its wholesale payments business. (CNBC)
* Dow component Coca-Cola (KO) reports its fourth quarter earningsthis morning before the opening bell. After-the-bell earnings reports today include Applied Materials (AMAT), Canopy Growth (CGC), CBS (CBS), Chemours (CC), Nvidia (NVDA), and Redfin (RDFN). (CNBC)
* Coca-Cola shares drop after earnings in line with estimates(CNBC)

* Congress today aimed to end a dispute over border security, and avoid another government shutdown, with legislation that includes nearly $1.4 billion for new physical barriers but not a concrete wall. A stalemate in December over President Donald Trump's request for $5.7 billion to help build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border led to a record-long government shutdown. (Reuters)
* Trump is considering a 60-day extension of the March 1 deadline for higher tariffs on Chinese imports, according to a Bloomberg report. The president was considering the extension so as to give two-way talks more time, the report said.
* Pentagon warns of 'weaponization of space' by China and Russia (CNBC)

* Equifax's (EFX) data breach stunned consumers, but where the data of those 143 million people disappeared to has remained a mystery. The prevailing theory is that the data was stolen by a nation-state for spying purposes. (CNBC)

* Former Apple lawyer used inside knowledge to trade ahead of earnings, claims SEC (CNBC)

NGD,investing,My Watchlist For 12/28/2020,"My Watchlist For 12/21/2020

$DHI: Such a beautiful ascending triangle play. Also a support area which is awesome. Needs to break EMA lines to show real strength, and Stoch showing divergence, and Vortex is showing life.
 
$ENBL: Rebound play, as it has bounced here before. Just needs to break the 50EMA line, and the 200EMA is your support area. Stoch is low, RSI was oversold, and VI cannot get much lower at all. Great value for a bounce.
 
$ERIC: Expensive, but perfect ascending triangle play. Once it breaks EMA lines it is will be massive. Indicators say it has room to drop still, which is fine. Could be a massive move soon.
 
$GFF: Another beautiful ascending triangle play. At support, but indicators say it may pull back but price action is what is important for this one.
 
$KTRA: Great penny stock channel. Once it breaks the 50 and 200EMA lines, it'll go crazy. Showing higher lows as well, RSI fair price. Great setup.
 
$LULU: Another beautiful ascending triangle. All Indicators say it is a great deal, and it is holding above the 200EMA. Has room to drop still, but eventually -- this will be a massive move.
 
$NGD: Simple channel up, and now a 50EMA bounce play. Stoch just reversed, RSI fair, and Vortex says good deal. 
 
$NIU: New channel play here, very good value. All indicators say it is a great value play here, and just needs to break EMA lines. 
 
$SPT: Resistance now being tested as a support; 50EMA bounce play. May drop to the channel up area, which is fine -- but for now the Stoch says it is gearing up for a move here.
 
$TAST: Channel that has higher lows over months now. Hanging above 200EMA which is great, and this channel is very strong. If it dies buy into the triangle channel and then go long.
 
$TNX: Fantastic deal here. Ascending Triangle, at support, if this breaks up gonna be fantastic.
 
$TRIL: Fantastic deal on a channel play here. Higher lows, and just has to hold above the 50EMA line. Indicators say it is tired, so it may pull back, but it is a great setup.

NFLX,wallstreetbets,Apple is reportedly losing $1 billion a year on its streaming service as churn levels increase,"Apple's (AAPL) streaming platform is losing a reported $1 billion a year as the company faces stiff competition and a more choosy consumer.

According to a report in the Information, Apple — which just shed around $700 billion as a result of Wall Street's latest tech rout — has consistently spent over $5 billion annually to beef up its content slate since launching in 2019. That number, though, dramatically decreased to just about $500 million last year, the report said.

Apple did not immediately respond to Yahoo Finance's request for comment.

The update comes as many media giants have pulled back on spending in favor of profitability. More streaming platforms are cracking down on password sharers and have also bundled their respective offerings to prevent churn, or users abandoning their subscription plans.

Last year, Apple partnered with Netflix (NFLX) and Comcast's Peacock (CMCSA) to launch a new bundle dubbed StreamSaver, exclusively available to Comcast broadband internet service customers for a cost of $15 a month. The monthly price of a solo Apple TV+ subscription currently sits at $9.99, although users can bundle Apple's streaming service with other Apple-related products like Apple Arcade and Apple News+.

It's unclear whether the recent bundles are helping.

According to data compiled by subscription analytics platform Antenna, Apple's streaming service had the highest churn percentage of all the major streaming platforms, with the exclusion of Starz, with 7% of users churning out of the service during the month of February, compared to just 2% of users for Netflix and 4% of users for Disney+.

Notably, Apple has adopted a strategy different from that of its competitors. For one, its content slate is more limited, although it does boast highly acclaimed titles, including award-winning series like ""Severance,"" ""Shrinking,"" and ""Ted Lasso."" It was also the first streaming platform to take home an Oscar win for best picture (thanks to ""Coda"").

In total, Apple TV+ productions have earned more than 2,500 nominations and 538 wins, CEO Tim Cook said on the company's January earnings call.

Apple TV+ does not release subscriber figures, although analysts have pegged total users at anywhere from 30 million to 40 million. Compared to Netflix, which boasts over 300 million subscribers thanks to its substantial global presence, Apple TV+ does not have high penetration in emerging markets, which have become increasingly important drivers as streaming hits peak saturation levels in the US and Canada.

""Apple's streaming service never set out to be No. 1,"" Santosh Rao, head of research at Manhattan Venture Partners, previously told Yahoo Finance. ""Apple is good at the game that they play, but it's not a mass appeal game. They want to be the creative storytellers. They're more focused.""

In January, Apple reported first quarter earnings that showed all-time highs for services revenue, which includes sales from businesses like Apple TV+, along with the App Store and Apple Music. Revenue for the division climbed to $26.34 billion for the period, compared to $23.12 billion in the prior year.",1329,219,1742494342.0,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-is-reportedly-losing-1-billion-a-year-on-its-streaming-service-as-churn-levels-increase-172901811.html,callsonreddit,"Apple is reportedly losing $1 billion a year on its streaming service as churn levels increase Apple's (AAPL) streaming platform is losing a reported $1 billion a year as the company faces stiff competition and a more choosy consumer.

NFLX,wallstreetbets,Why $MGNI Will Soar After $NFLX’s Blowout Earnings Yesterday,"So after I posted my YOLO on Magnite this morning, some of you mentioned in the comments that it would be helpful for me to drop a DD. Buckle up, my friends— why I'm long Magnite $MGNI

(Although for some reason I don’t think of them as “Magnite” in my head, I say it at Magini or Maggie because that how the ticker sounds lol)

Anyway, let me explain why I think it’s time to load the boat on shares of this company, and especially how it’s a play to cash in on the blowout earnings report from Netflix $NFLX yesterday.



# The Play: Buying $MGNI on takeaways from $NFLX’s blowout quarter yesterday

Obviously, the smart money move isn’t to wait for a stock to go up to buy it. It’s to buy when news comes out that you *know* will positively impact future earnings or another company in the sector/industry. 

Magnite has been crushing it with partnerships (Disney, Netflix, Samsung, FIFA, and United Airlines are outlined below), and the holiday season being during Q4 means CTV ad spend went through the roof.

Think about it: over the holidays, what were you and your family doing? Watching Disney/Netflix? Streaming sports? Magnite powers the ads you see on those platforms. Now, they’re set to rake in massive revenue from the holiday season.



# Why Netflix's Q4 Success Signals Big Wins for Magnite 🚀

Netflix's Q4 2024 earnings smashed expectations, revealing major growth in the ad-supported streaming market—a sector Magnite ($MGNI) dominates. Here’s the breakdown:

1. Ad Tier Adoption Surges: 55% of Netflix’s new subscribers in ad-supported markets chose the ad tier, doubling Netflix’s ad revenue YoY in 2024 and projected to double again in 2025. This expands the addressable market for connected TV (CTV) advertising tech, where Magnite is the clear leader.
2. Magnite's Market Leadership: As the world’s largest independent sell-side advertising platform, Magnite already earns \~50% of its revenue from CTV and expects to grow that segment by 15% or more annually. Their platform is projected to generate billions in ad spend over the coming years, aligning with Netflix's growth trajectory.
3. Publisher Monetization Boom: Netflix’s success in monetizing its ad tier proves advertisers want premium CTV inventory. Magnite specializes in helping publishers monetize content, benefiting directly from this growing demand.

Netflix’s stellar results confirm that ad-supported streaming is here to stay, creating a massive tailwind for Magnite. $MGNI is poised to ride this wave of growth.



# Facts & Data: Magnite’s Tailwinds 🌬️

1. **$25 Billion+ TAM for CTV Advertising -** The connected TV market is exploding, and Magnite is sitting at the center of it all. They’re the world’s largest independent sell-side advertising platform, making them the key player for streaming ad monetization.
2. [**Disney Partnership**](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/10/23/2967786/0/en/Disney-and-Magnite-Announce-Two-Year-Deal-Renewal.html)
   * Expanded to include LATAM inventory, podcasts, and live sports.
   * Monetizing College Football live streams on ESPN.
   * Jamie Power, Disney SVP: *“Magnite consistently scales its capabilities to meet client needs, helping us stay ahead of emerging market trends.”*
      1. Note that Magnite allows brands like Disney to whitelist their ad tech as “their own,” so you might hear Disney talk about the work they are doing to build their ad stack over the next several years.
3. [**Netflix’s Partnership**](https://www.magnite.com/blog/netflix-selects-magnite-as-key-global-programmatic-advertising-partner/)

      1. Note that Magnite allows brands like Netflix to whitelist their ad tech as “their own,” so you might hear Netflix talk about the work they are doing to build their ad stack over the next several years.
4. **Other Partnerships from the past year**

# Financials: A Strong Foundation 

* **Q3 2024 Performance**:
   * Revenue: $162M (+8% YoY)
   * Net Income: $5.2M 
   * Adjusted EBITDA: $50.6M
   * CTV contribution ex-TAC: $64.4M (+23% YoY)
* **Q4 2024 Earnings Expectations**:With the holiday season and their partnerships firing on all cylinders, expect significant upside. 

# Simple Explanation: How Magnite Works 

Ever watched a show on Netflix and seen an ad? That’s where Magnite comes in. They’re the tech backbone that connects advertisers with streaming services. Think of them as a digital middleman, making sure the right ads get to the right people, at the right time. For every transaction, Magnite earns a fee.

# Why $MGNI Will Pop 

1. The **Netflix & Disney partnerships** will help fuel this, in addition to other recent partnership announcements outlined above. Both streaming giants are leaning heavily into ad-supported models, with Magnite’s platform as their backbone.
2. The holiday season drove massive engagement on CTV platforms. Think family binge-watching sessions and College Football bowl games.
3. Magnite’s **tech leadership** is cementing its dominance in CTV, digital display, and mobile advertising.



**TL;DR**

Netflix’s earnings yesterday made one thing clear: the future of ad-supported streaming is booming, and Magnite is perfectly positioned to capitalize. Operating in a sector with a $25B+ TAM, blockbuster partnerships, and surging CTV growth, $MGNI is a no-brainer with only a $2.3B market cap.

**Position:** I’m long like Donkey Kong—6,330 shares deep. I don’t mess with calls, but if that’s your vibe, I’d go with March calls to play the earnings pop. If anyone wants to throw up a technical analysis of $MGNI, or discuss in the comments, I’d love to see it (because I don’t understand that shit).

Buckle up, my friends— why I'm long Magnite $MGNI

(Although for some reason I don’t think of them as “Magnite” in my head, I say it at Magini or Maggie because that how the ticker sounds lol)

Anyway, let me explain why I think it’s time to load the boat on shares of this company, and especially how it’s a play to cash in on the blowout earnings report from Netflix $NFLX yesterday.



# The Play: Buying $MGNI on takeaways from $NFLX’s blowout quarter yesterday

Obviously, the smart money move isn’t to wait for a stock to go up to buy it. It’s to buy when news comes out that you *know* will positively impact future earnings or another company in the sector/industry. 

Magnite has been crushing it with partnerships (Disney, Netflix, Samsung, FIFA, and United Airlines are outlined below), and the holiday season being during Q4 means CTV ad spend went through the roof.

Think about it: over the holidays, what were you and your family doing? Watching Disney/Netflix? Streaming sports? Magnite powers the ads you see on those platforms. Now, they’re set to rake in massive revenue from the holiday season.



# Why Netflix's Q4 Success Signals Big Wins for Magnite 🚀

Netflix's Q4 2024 earnings smashed expectations, revealing major growth in the ad-supported streaming market—a sector Magnite ($MGNI) dominates. Here’s the breakdown:

1. Ad Tier Adoption Surges: 55% of Netflix’s new subscribers in ad-supported markets chose the ad tier, doubling Netflix’s ad revenue YoY in 2024 and projected to double again in 2025. This expands the addressable market for connected TV (CTV) advertising tech, where Magnite is the clear leader.
2. Magnite's Market Leadership: As the world’s largest independent sell-side advertising platform, Magnite already earns \~50% of its revenue from CTV and expects to grow that segment by 15% or more annually. Their platform is projected to generate billions in ad spend over the coming years, aligning with Netflix's growth trajectory.
3. Publisher Monetization Boom: Netflix’s success in monetizing its ad tier proves advertisers want premium CTV inventory. Magnite specializes in helping publishers monetize content, benefiting directly from this growing demand.

Netflix’s stellar results confirm that ad-supported streaming is here to stay, creating a massive tailwind for Magnite. $MGNI is poised to ride this wave of growth.

# Simple Explanation: How Magnite Works 

Ever watched a show on Netflix and seen an ad? That’s where Magnite comes in. They’re the tech backbone that connects advertisers with streaming services. Think of them as a digital middleman, making sure the right ads get to the right people, at the right time. For every transaction, Magnite earns a fee.

NFLX,wallstreetbets,$MGNI YOLO after $NFLX earnings,"Netflix just announced that its ad-supported tiers now account for 55% of sign-ups in markets where it’s offered, with memberships on these plans growing 30% quarter-over-quarter. They’re doubling down on ads in 2025, aiming to scale and improve their advertising offerings. 

Here’s why that’s huge for Magnite ($MGNI).

Starting summer 2024, Magnite became Netflix’s  global programmatic ad partner. Magnite is the largest independent sell-side advertising platform, specializing in digital and streaming ad formats. Think of them as the tech infrastructure behind the ads that we see on platforms like Netflix. 

As of Magnite’s last earnings call, Netflix is slated to become one of Magnite’s largest customers by the end of 2025.

Greetings my friends, and prepare yourselves. Join me as we learn the wey of gey.

What you see before your very eyes is an experimental portfolio I have made. No real money is involved, but essentially this is a watchlist on E\*Trade with share quantities assigned to each stock to fit my hypothetical allocations.

The purpose of this portfolio--gey.

By tilting heavily to the gey factor, we hope to realize the rawdog premium.

The core of this portfolio is Grindr (GRND). It holds a 27% allocation (I had to convince myself to not make it 30% for diversification's sake, although such is still not off the table entirely). The path of gey is risky, but potentially rewarding. Grindr holds what many consider to be somewhat of a monopoly on the LGBTQ+ dating and hookup market. Only the individual who achieves great wealth from Grindr stock can become a true Lord of the Gey.

The other stocks that makeup The Fruitcake Portfolio are stocks that one might consider to be gey-in-some-wey. In reality, this means we must invest in stocks typically designated ""women"" stocks. Now personally, I love stocks of companies whose target audience is women. Just because the product isn't some sci-fi tech robot A.I. missile etc etc, doesn't mean that it isn't a good company with amazing potential. I personally already own ELF and \[redacted\] in my real accounts. However, in this portfolio, beauty, cosmetics, and baby/household care products (diapers, etc) make up around 26% in total (17% for ELF, 9% for \[redacted\]).

Hims & Hers (HIMS) was selected for it's exposure to the men's sexual health market. They got ED pills, condoms, lube, prostate massagers, cock rings, etc. With the addition of a 10% HIMS allocation, The Fruitcake Portfolio will be on all fours, back arched, with its cheeks up in the air for exposure to the chode of this lucrative industry. In addition to HIMS, there is also a small 2% allocation to Church & Dwight (CHD), because they make Trojan condoms.

FBTC is the Fidelity BitCoin ETF. This is the only crypto play in the portfolio and makes up 10% of the portfolio.

If Warren Buffet has Coca Cola (KO), then The Fruitcake Portfolio has Starbucks (SBUX), because Starbucks is zesty, and therefore, perfectly suited, as those who regularly drink from Starbucks follow the wey of gey. Similarly, Cheesecake Factory (CAKE) is more of a growthy-value stability stock in the restaurant sector. I wanted to originally find a vegan or vegetarian stock, however those tend to fail. However, CAKE actually has been expanding its business lately with the restaurant Flower Child. Flower Child serves vegan, vegetarian, paleo dishes, and more. So yes, CAKE is a bit of a compromise pick, but I think it fulfills the requirement of gey.

There is an 11% allocation split between Victoria's Secret (VSCO), Lululemon (LULU), and Nike (NKE). Overall, this is more of a value play and a smaller weight. VSCO is the primary holding here.

Disney (DIS) and Netflix (NFLX) are tiny allocations to streaming services. Need I explain why they are perfect for The Fruitcake Portfolio? If you are a 35 year old male millennial, and you still visit Mickey Mouse every year and take pictures with Cinderella, then you are no novice to the wey of gey.

Finally, we have a tiny 1% allocation to Google (GOOG). Literally the alphabet company.

Something interesting to note is that this portfolio actually tilts very heavily into midcaps. Once ELF becomes a large cap, then things will be more balanced. I’ve considered adding a SCV as well.

\----------------

For stocks and ETFS that didn't make the cut, I had:

TSLA & FSLR: The wey of gey is partial to EVs and clean energy.

VEGN: Basically a cruelty-free S&P 500. Considered including this and removing a bunch of the large cap stocks in the portfolio.

\[redacted\]: An OTC Malaysian stock that I could probably buy through interactive broker. It's particularly NSFW.

\[redacted\]: Weed Stocks.

TGT: Target is Target.

BBWI: Bath and Bodyworks for scented candles and slippery bathtub moments--with bubbles (ofc).

RVLV: Clothing Retailer.

\----------------

If anyone has any ideas of how they might improve this portfolio, feel free to let me know. Any interesting stocks that you think might fit well in the mix? Would you swap out anything?

Thesis:

Pros:
-DAU growth surging. Google realizes their search sucks and is sending droves of people to Reddit. 

-Ad revenue growing strongly. They are finally figuring out how to monetize the site after 2 decades.

-Subreddits have very specific niches and are pure gold to advertisers. Want to advertise to NJ moms that enjoy eating grilled lobsters while wearing fluorescent green thongs? There’s probably a subreddit with 20,000 members floating around.

-Licensing reams of data to LLM/AI companies. This can be thought of a very high margin annuity as data can go stale and needs to keep pouring in.

-AI is efficiently translating all the English content to other languages, which will cause an explosion of growth internationally.  

-Low hosting and operating costs as mainly text-based. 

-User generated content means not spending billions on creating content like $nflx.

-CFO is solid and actually gives a shit about GAAP numbers and not adjusted EBIDTA BS.

-SBC is something they don’t want to go bonkers on like SNAP. They are very cognizant of dilution. 

-Probably the best place online for brands to connect with customers and to also gauges brand temperature. Very authentic human interactions and discussions due to the huge amount of users and the downvoting system which gets rid of bot replies and pushes good content to the top. 

-Massive moat / barrier to entry. How can it be replicated? Would be extremely difficult and costly.

-Can really start to get a piece of the global advertising pie if they can fix their search function.

Cons
-Google can stop promoting Reddit in search results, which would limit user growth.

-Users that come in from Google aren’t logged in, thus generate less revenue from ads.

-Once they capture the low hanging fruit from running relevant ads, what is the growth strategy that gets them to a much higher valuation ($100 billion+)?

-Probably the best place online for brands to connect with customers and to also gauges brand temperature. Very authentic human interactions and discussions due to the huge amount of users and the downvoting system which gets rid of bot replies and pushes good content to the top. 

-Massive moat / barrier to entry. How can it be replicated? Would be extremely difficult and costly.

-Can really start to get a piece of the global advertising pie if they can fix their search function.

Cons
-Google can stop promoting Reddit in search results, which would limit user growth.

-Users that come in from Google aren’t logged in, thus generate less revenue from ads.

-Once they capture the low hanging fruit from running relevant ads, what is the growth strategy that gets them to a much higher valuation ($100 billion+)?

It looks like Netflix has reached its limit in terms of new subscribers and price increases. Daily active users are down in all three months of Q3, and that's the first time that's happened since late 2021, when the stock was also falling (source: BofA research note, 10/7/2024: Internet/e Commerce September app data: Mixed trends with Amazon DAU acceleration a bright spot).

Aside from the content (which I think is declining in quality), Netflix's ""you can cancel at any time"" service literally has no moat.

Puts played nicely, Jpow cried uncle and markets went uppy downy for a few hours before the market decided to do a slooooow incline right after a magical green dildo overnight run. Bull run yes?

No, I don’t think so.

I try to balance between time in market and timing the market.

From here until the next day that ends in TOBER I am keeping an eye on QQQ and SPY relative to their August close. I am still committed to a Sept close lower than August and yeah you could see 5 more green days before a massive turd but I’ll be swinging puts on these.

Today is OPEX so I am treading lightly, but at some point today I’ll be eyeing Tuesday puts probably $5-8 OTM for both index. Holding over the weekend isn’t my thang so I usually enter those late afternoon.

NFLX,wallstreetbets,"The next tech giant. Why $HOOD, $PLTR and $DKNG are the investment opportunities of a lifetime. (Part 1)","I believe the story of the last 20 years of stock market is that one tech startup can disrupt an entire sector and join the tech giant club. For many sectors, information is king and turns out a company with a few 1000 people who have studied the science of information can outperform millions of people who aren't so scientifically rigorous. Now some sectors are not so prone to be disrupted by these information science experts. And if you asked me 20 years ago which sectors will be disrupted in what order, I would've guessed wrong.

$AMZN Turns out the value of millions of retail stores across the west was not in their inventory, their brand or their location. Amazon proved their value was in knowing who wants what item when and where. Information. How can millions of retail shop compete with amazon when they already have my payment information (how) my location (where) and all amazon has to figure out is what do I want, which I'm happy to tell them by typing one word or expression in a search bar instead of walking around Home Depot trying to find a employee who's not too busy and has every reason to avoid me. Sentences and social interactions just can't compete with 1s and 0s. Now I wish I figured this all out 20 years ago when amazon still a great investment opportunity, but how could I have known Jeff would overcome all the hurdles by building this impossible network of warehouses and delivery. I won't make the same mistake twice.

$NFLX (movies). $SPOT (music) $GOOG,$META(ads, communication, media), $AAPL, $MSFT etc... These are 100% information sectors that I would've guessed would be disrupted. But these were winner takes all. How could I know Facebook wouldn't fail like MySpace and Friendster? That iphones would be better than blackberry and nokia? How could I know Yahoo would become a total failure when they had such a commanding lead in the early internet era. These stocks will keep going up but they're not the 100 baggers they once were.

And so in true wsb fashion, the question becomes, what tech startup is poised to do the same thing to their respective sector. Let's assume no company can be worth over $5T in the next 10 years. We need a company worth less than $50B whose sector is still ripe for the taking, and whose in the business of information. A sector whose legal hurdles have kept the incumbents safe from the efficiency of tech startups. A sector who created legal barriers that could resist a decade longer than taxi drivers could resist $Uber, or hotels vs $ABNB.

There are 3 answers : Finance, defense and gambling. These sectors have the highest barrier to entry of any. Their regulatory agencies are basically just a revolving door between government and industry. They are the most regulated sectors out there but they are finally starting to crack. Crony capitalism only works for so long.

From a pure computer science perspective, overtaking these sectors is not technical challenge, in the same way Unity is failing at becoming the universal game engine. There's no legal barrier to become a game engine. Activison, Take two interactive, Ubisoft, etc.. everyone wants $U to succeed but they're now years behind on their promised revolutionary Data oriented technology stack. Everyone wants $TSLA Full self driving to succeed, but they're years behind Musk's first promises of success by what? 2017?. But those are technically hard challenges, maybe impossible with current hardware limitations. Now if you want to bet on their success, good luck to you but I'm not interested in those investments. Only someone at the cutting-edge of those technologies can make well-informed decisions. Only someone at the cutting-edge of semi conducters could've guessed $NVDA would obliterate intel and amd. I won't pretend to have any such knowledge about the future as I make these observations about the past. This is not what this tech investment thesis is about.

And so in conclusion, three stocks stand out in their positioning and the state of their respective industry :

**Chipotle $53.48** \- Expecting 7%-10% move to upside, $50 to act as strong support if move to downside. I've opened calendars at $50, $55 (to sell before earning's), and $60. Ratio 3-1-3 so the ATM $55 cals just to pay off some of the risk, to sell *before* earning's. Extremely cheap cals with very high reward. This is what I look for. Win on one side totally offsets losses of other side. Expecting price $57-$59.

**Google $179.39** \- Expecting 10% move to the upside or flat, the market sold off heavily this week but Google was largely unaffected in-comparison. I've opened calendars at $170, $185, $200. Ratio 1-3-4 so the ATM $185 cals will sell half before earning's and others to hold through. If dumps downside protection $170 will cover some of the cost the other cals. This is my big play of the week.

**Vertiv $85.28** \- Expecting $80 to act like solid support, the next earning's will be their best quarter yet. It all comes down to forward guidance. I've opened $80 and $100 strike cals, may close everything before earning's as this company is too volatile to predict where jump will be or if trades flat. Jumps are 25% over the week which would put this around $110 pushing past its strong resistance of $105.

**American Airlines $10.61** \- Same story as Delta, should have good quarter compared to past quarters and report good earning's just like Delta and then sell off 3% barley moving up or down cause it's a boring not very volatile company. I have calenders at $9.5, $10.5, and $12. Holding through earning's everything, extremely cheap cals I probably shouldn't play this at all but all sides covered.

This week I closed $650 NFLX calendar for 240% gain, closed TSM $165 put for 204% gain which could've been 600%+ if held *through* earning's, but closed early for guaranteed profit and held the $205 cal which became a loss; still profitable overall closing the $165 and $185 calendars before earning's for profit.

NFLX,wallstreetbets,"I am shorting NFLX into earnings next week, and so can you!","

Hello fellow regards, your local area degen here with another great short idea in a raging bull market! Interested? Listen on. Lets talk about Netflix. Netflix touched an ATH of \~695 then double-topped off. This is where I actually opened my position for a 650/610 put spread for 7/19. So, why am I shorting it?

NFLX,wallstreetbets,Robinhood Q1 Earnings - Is It A Trap?,"**Summary:**

I believe Robinhood is poised to blow expectations out of the water for it's Q1 earnings after hours today. The question is whether Q2 guidance is just as promising.

* [Positive GAAP Net Income](https://s28.q4cdn.com/948876185/files/doc_financials/2023/q4/Q4-2023-Earnings-Presentation.pdf) in two of the last three quarters - growth in profitability will show Robinhood has turned it around for good
* Strong product velocity with introduction of it's Gold credit card and growth of it's Retirement Products
* International expansion into the UK and EU will grow user base
* Promising [January and February 2024 metrics](https://s28.q4cdn.com/948876185/files/doc_events/2024/Mar/13/robinhood-markets-inc-february-2024-monthly-metrics.pdf)

**Background:**  It doesn't take much to convince WSB to be bullish on $HOOD. Both equities and crypto have been reaching new all time highs in 2024. A telltale sign is the reemergence of meme stocks and alt coins - degenerate gamblers are once again watching their lifesavings bounce up and down on a stupid green app on their phone.

https://preview.redd.it/dvtszvfdd8zc1.png?width=2762&format=png&auto=webp&s=4cf88eeab30867c40464f42ab2f3ae47332e9db1

**Reaching Profitability:** In Q4 2023, Robinhood posted it's second profitable quarter ever with a net income of $30M. Additionally, both equities and crypto have been skyrocketing all of 2024, which drive more active users and more transactions on their platform. Favorable market conditions will likely show Robinhood is maturing out of their growth-at-all-costs stage.

More importantly however was a decline in Total Operating Expenses. In 2023, Robinhood had $2.4B in expenses, resulting in negative profitability accounting for the whole year. However for 2024, the company projects only $1.9B. This shows the company is finally maturing as a company and will continue to focus on delivering profitability over growth-at-all-costs. If revenues are up and the company has accurate projections on operating expenses, the company will have positive net income again.

**International Expansion:** Some important metrics to look out for are related to Robinhood's expansion of stock trading into the UK and crypto trading into the EU. This is the app's first expansion into the international market.  The number of users only grew 2% (400k funded accounts) year over year between 2022 and 2023, and has essentially become stagnant after Q2 2021. This app desperately needs new users for growth. To determine how much it will grow we can look at a failed attempt to expand in 2019 (due to regulations) - Robinhood announced a 300k waiting list for the UK. Lets be cautious and use this same number despite it likely being higher in 2024. 300k extra users would 1.28% growth in funded customers in the UK alone. We know from it's Q4 report that it generates $81 per user however nearly 60% of revenue comes from margin investing, which is not allowed in the UK due to regulations. Now for some math:

300,000 new users x ($81 rev/user x 0.4 excluding margin rev) = $9.7M additional revenue from the UK expansion. Q4 had $471M in revenue.

Note: This plans were announced last quarter but actually launched in March 2024. These number are more useful in predicting guidance for Q2 rather than earnings for Q1.

**Possible Speed Bumps:**  We've seen many times over the last few weeks where beating earnings expectations has an inverse affect on the stock price. META, TSLA, NFLX just to name a few. Although I am fully confident Robinhood will meet and exceed expectations, I'm concerned it could still tank after hours if it does not forecast another stellar Q2. 

Consider that the stock has already gone up 61%(!) over the last three months and is valued at $15B. It is trading at 64 forward P/E. For context Paypal is 12 and Square is 21. It must has very very strong Q2 forecast. 

It's possible Monthly Users and Trading Volume will shrink in Q2 due to the recent slump both equities and crypto. The question is can international users and new products like the credit card offset these losses?

NFLX,wallstreetbets,Call Credit Spreads 3 Month Update. $58k - $204k,"

Well, there it is, A lot of people DMd me asking for updates after my DD post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bgg3f3/my_almost_invincible_call_credit_spread_strategy/) where I went over my strategy to sell far OTM call credit spreads on stocks reporting earnings that week. Since today is the 3-month anniversary of the day I started, here is an update/story.

It started many months ago, Setptember to be exact, when I was selling cash secured puts on average stocks like META, MSFT, etc.. then everything changed in December when I decided to sell puts on AMC. AMC tanked and my puts got assigned, so I doubled down and it kept falling. Before I knew it, I was leveraged to the tits. Full send, max margin in AMC shares which you can see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/18wr5vz/the_first_and_probably_last_green_ytd_chart_i/) - a photo of my portfolio is in the comments. Unfortunately, AMC continued to go down.

Around January 13th, I said fuck it. I sold EVERYTHING at a huge loss. I settled on keeping $58k and went full send into NFLX Put credit spreads barely out of the money. NFLX rose on earnings and the strategy was born.

I haven't kept track of my total profit per week since I started, but here is the last 4 weeks (I know I'm missing some fees in my weekly ending amounts).

Well, there it is, A lot of people DMd me asking for updates after my DD post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bgg3f3/my_almost_invincible_call_credit_spread_strategy/) where I went over my strategy to sell far OTM call credit spreads on stocks reporting earnings that week. Since today is the 3-month anniversary of the day I started, here is an update/story.

It started many months ago, Setptember to be exact, when I was selling cash secured puts on average stocks like META, MSFT, etc.. then everything changed in December when I decided to sell puts on AMC. AMC tanked and my puts got assigned, so I doubled down and it kept falling. Before I knew it, I was leveraged to the tits. Full send, max margin in AMC shares which you can see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/18wr5vz/the_first_and_probably_last_green_ytd_chart_i/) - a photo of my portfolio is in the comments. Unfortunately, AMC continued to go down.

Around January 13th, I said fuck it. I sold EVERYTHING at a huge loss. I settled on keeping $58k and went full send into NFLX Put credit spreads barely out of the money. NFLX rose on earnings and the strategy was born.

Eventually, I did more research. I made the spreadsheet you see in my DD post and have since updated it further.

NFLX,wallstreetbets,This week's game - a secular rally coming?,"Earnings season is in full swing, and there are some easy pickings if you're on the long side. Here are some key projections:

**CPI:**

* CPI is likely to come in about 10 basis points under consensus expectations per my model.
* Despite a hot jobs report and rising gas prices, productivity gains and a slowing pace of rent/rent equivalent increases will keep CPI in check.
* This could put rate cuts back on the table.
* If this thesis holds, expect the Russell 2000 (RUT) and Nasdaq-100 (QQQ) to rally.
* Money draining from bonds to stocks this Wednesday.

**Banks:**

* JPM may kick off a bank rally.
* If the inflation thesis holds, banks will start to look awfully cheap as earnings come through.

**Tech Names:**

* Not every stock will move up - track the fundamentals.
* GOOG and AAPL are likely to outperform NVDA (this might be a hot take, but it doesn't say anything of long-term prospects, but the fact NVDA susceptible to some bumps, whereas AAPL negativity is peaking just as it has for GOOG).
* META and NFLX looking pretty solid in the short term.
* Look for unloved tech names that have been left behind due to the AI hype (e.g. AAPL).
* Cybersecurity and IT services companies are expected to benefit.
* Non-AI chip companies offer a safer downside play with potential upside.

**Energy/Utilities:**

* The oil sector is getting crowded, so target utilities and natural gas exposure instead.
* A note on oil prices: $100 oil is not what it used to be.  US is relatively insulated from the negative impact due to its domestic production.  In fact, high oil and high stock markets can coexist.

**Gold:**

* Save yourselves, there are better plays. Goldbugs will not love this market into the year.  As inflation comes down, so will Gold.  Start taking the profits.

There may be some pockets to short, like Boeing or Tesla, but be cautious and use stop losses, as these names could get caught up in a broader market rally.  Time to buy, buy, buy!

NFLX,wallstreetbets,"You missed META, NFLX, GOOGL? The answer isn't AAPL, its actually UNH","UNH is an obvious play. Its basically been flat for 2 years now, and the recent cyberattack nonsense will likely pass. The other issue is DOJ, but in my view its just noise. The ship sailed a generation ago since Kaiser Permanente has been doing the same thing UNH is with Optum forever. Good luck trying to un-fuk the US healthcare system. To really drive this home, so far UNH has spent $10mm+ lobbying (top 50) and while DOJ is not congress, let's not pretend congress doesn't put pressure on the DOJ.  Good luck trying to un-fuk the US healthcare system.

This thing has been a beast of a compounder for a decade that has silently performed better than GOOG/GOOGL since March of 2014 (10 year total returns), returning 21.5% annualized vs 18.5% for GOOG - with way less volatility (this means options are cheap for those who can't connect the dots).

UNH is trading at \~15x NTM FCF, a discount to \~20x NTM FCF it has traded historically over last 5 years.   For those who don't care about FCF, trading at 17x NTM PE while market is trading at 23x+ NTM PE.

This thing likely rerates to 20x NTM FCF in 12 months if not sooner and with $34 of FCF/Share by end of 2025 we are talking about $650+ stock within 12-16 months.  

Now, I'm not usually one for OTM calls, but check out my position below (IV less than 25% on these). Thinking about tossing in some call spreads in the high 500s for that extra juice. I like to avoid theta decay as much as possible.

NFLX,wallstreetbets,"You missed META, NFLX, GOOGL? Try AAPL","I think AAPL is an obvious play. It hasn't participated in this 2024 rally at all and is due for a catch-up play. Two main reasons why AAPL has been lagging: slowing growth (mainly China) and lack of AI hype. The slowing growth is priced into the stock. Earnings expectations are already low for AAPL.  

AAPL reminds me of GOOGL this year when it was in similar situation of dumpster fire but then broke out after it finally worked out Gemini. AAPL already told you that it's going to make a push to AI, which should mean multiple expansion for AAPL stock. My guess is that in June we'll see Siri being totally revamped and actually be useful. Don't get me wrong this June WWDC event needs to be successful or this stock will stay dumpster fire. We need to see some sort of hype and the market needs to be convinced that that the next iphone will be a must-have due its new AI features. If there's anyone who can market the shit out of anything, it's AAPL.

The whole kitchen sink was thrown at AAPL recently. You have dissapointing product launch of its Vision Pro. You have the news about negative China sales. You have this big DOJ case come out of no where. You had an analyst downgrade yesterday. And even with all of that, it didn't make a new low from March 6th. Unless there's an unexpected market-wide correction, I can't see AAPL going lower this year.

This whole market recently has been a rotation trade. That is why the market has gone up even without AAPL and now without NVDA. The market has been broadening. It will continue to find laggards and re-allocate money from hot areas. AAPL is that obvious laggard right now and it needs to eventually participate for the market to continue signficiantly higher.

NFLX,wallstreetbets,Disney (DIS) Analysis,"For the next analysis we will be looking at Walt Disney Co (NYSE: DIS) earnings. This company is a staple of American culture but has struggled tremendously in recent years due to Covid-19 and more recently adjusting to the direction of the industry in terms of streaming. The company released Disney+ to compete with the likes of Netflix and others. Many analysts are expecting the company to perform well with their theme parks, but many question marks remain on the profitability and viability of the streaming service they offer. Disney will report earnings after the bell on February 7th with the earnings call to follow. Guidance will be incredibly important with this report, as will streaming numbers. With that being said, let’s dive into the analysis and see where the stock could potentially head post earnings and in the future.

Description: 

Walt Disney Co (NYSE: DIS) is an American media conglomerate that acts as an umbrella for many household names like Disney, Pixar, ESPN, and 20th Century Studios. The company has recently developed the Disney+ streaming service to compete with companies like Netflix and develop a more thorough revenue stream. The company is plagued with many issues, from performing poorly in the box office to losing money with their streaming service. However, there should be positive information about ESPN+ which is also owned by Disney and showcases many sports, particularly the NFL so I expect this to be a big positive as well. This quarter Disney hopes to report increased performance within their theme parks, increasing subscriber numbers within Disney+, and a reduction in the operating loss of the business. Earlier this year the company went through a round of layoffs where 7,000 jobs were cut in hopes of reducing costs. We hope to see those cost reductions acting positively and increasing the efficiency of the business. The strong sentiment on Wall Street is that the company is considered a buy, which could certainly be the case if the company manages to overcome a poor quarter in the box office and calm the worries of many with their guidance. 

Financial Breakdown:

LTM Price Increase: $111.63 – $99.29 (-11.05%)
Subscribers: 150.2 Million Subscribers (+2.38% Q3)
Revenue increase: +5% YoY Q3 and +29% YTD 2023
Competitors: Netflix (NFLX), Sony (SONY), Fox Corporation (FOX)

Earnings:

Q3 Reported EPS: $0.82 (+15.11% delta from expected) | Q3 Reported Revenue: $21.24B (-0.79% delta)

Stock Move: Stock jumped 6.91% after earnings

Q4 Expected EPS: $1.04 | Q4 Expected Revenue: $23.77B

Verdict: 

With Disney reporting earnings after market close on February 7th, it will be difficult to find an easy play because of the uncertainty, along with potential opportunities present within the company. Theme parks will most likely be a strong positive, with more individuals visiting this winter quarter particularly during school breaks. Several eyewitness reports suggest it was “unprecedently crowded this year”. This, along with the effects of earlier layoffs should hopefully slim down the company and reduce their operating losses. But, despite all the potential positives major threats also exist in the likes of Disney+ performance. If streaming numbers come in lower than expected, or guidance is viewed as negative for the rest of the year, the stock price will get pummeled no matter how successful the theme parks were. The lack of box office films also poses a threat this quarter. Several flops could put a damper on the earnings report. Next up, my opinion on how this company will fare this quarter. 

Prior to providing my opinion, I must preface with a disclosure that options trading is extremely risky and losing all your money is a very real possibility and that this is not financial advice. Whether you elect to agree with my personal decision is entirely up to you, and this post is simply intended to provide more information into the company. Looking at this earnings report, I understand the concern of where the company is heading due to a lack of box office production in recent quarters. However, I think the combination of theme parks, layoffs, and improved guidance for 2024 will make the stock pop ~7% or so to a price of about $105.00. Looking at the contracts available, I did not purchase too many calls due to the uncertainty present and better opportunities in the market. However, I did pick up 3 $100 Calls expiring February 9th in anticipation of a potential bounce IF AND ONLY IF subscription numbers come in better than expected and guidance is positive. It won’t matter how good earnings are if numbers or guidance disappoints. Overall, this play is very risky but I think the positives outweigh the negatives making me lean toward an increase post earnings. 

We have a few more earnings to play this week (PYPL, PINS, etc.), so expect to see more posts like this one. Please leave a like and comment if you want to see more. Good luck!

NFLX,wallstreetbets,Best. Day. Ever.,"After a month of sideways trades I finally got something right.  

Made quite a few trades but my biggest positions were in NVDA and AMD calls that I bought yesterday. Held until just after lunch, could’ve held on alittle longer but was getting nervous.

Took those gains put them into quite a few different positions but the main ones being NFLX Puts, AMD Puts and NVDA Puts. Rode those down this afternoon for a nice gain and sold some but held on to a few. Still very bullish on those companies long term but expect we’ll see 2-3% pullback from ATH in the next few days.

Proably going to get wrecked on my TSLA calls tomorrow  but was just to irresistible to take the contrarian position with how much of a pull back we’ve had the last month. 

But that’s tomorrow, a win is a win and I’m cracking a beer🍻.

NFLX,wallstreetbets,NFLX beat has made me bearish on theatre stocks and SBUX looks like it wants to die.,"In 2023 for the short amount of time I was bearish (flipped after I saw reverse repo), I was ALWAYS scared to buy NFLX puts. Majority people I know are just staying in because outside is too expensive. The problem is, it is getting worse. Last week I saw a gas station charge $6 for 2 gatorades and lost it.

Anyway, its has performed well as I predicted because even with the price increase, it is a huge amount of savings compared to 1 theatre trip. Movies used to be a good place for the US romance sector before it took a dump like AMC stock. 

As long as things are too expensive, I expect NFLX to grow. I think all high ticket items are going to get a beating. SBUX has the nastiest H&S I have ever seen in my life because they continue to think charging crazy money for a sugar crash coffee in these times is a good idea. Pepsico Rockstars are way better value for the working folk, and they have crazy good zero calorie flavors, in my opinion, compared to Monster. The caffiene content doesnt even come close, with a grande at SBUX being like 95mg for $5, and rockstar being 200mg for half the price. 

I expect stupid expensive crap to fail. Apple headsets I think are going to be a disaster (maybe they already are). Anyways, I think AMC/SBUX puts for me.

NFLX,wallstreetbets,$NFLX Earnings Thread,"We’ve just ended our first year with Ted and Greg as co-CEOs and, under their leadership, Netflix achieved the key financial objectives we set at the start of 2023. We’ve:

* Accelerated our growth, exiting the year with 12% revenue growth, up from 6% in 2022;
* Grown our FY23 operating margin to 21% from 18% in 2022, ahead of our 20% target;
* Increased our free cash flow to $6.9B for 2023.

The year has shown the need for Netflix to balance consistency and continuous improvement with adaptability. In 2024, we see big opportunities to:

*  Increase our value to members by further improving the core (series and film), while broadening our offering (games, live and sports-adjacent programming);
* Tap into a significant new long term revenue and profit pool by scaling our ads business;
* Deepen our connection with fans through our marketing, consumer products andinnovative new live experiences.

We believe there is plenty of room for growth ahead as streaming expands, and our north star remains the same: to thrill members with our entertainment. If we can continue to improve Netflix faster than the competition, we’ll have an increasingly valuable business – for consumers, creators and shareholders.

* Revenue: $8.83 billion (actual) vs $8.72 billion (expected)
* EPS: $2.11 (actual) vs $2.22 (expected)

NFLX,wallstreetbets,12k Netflix YOLO (not a recommendation play like my previous TRV play),"[Positions](https://imgur.com/0DSNLcj)

Hey y'all I'm back. Netflix call spreads expiring Friday for the earnings after market close.

Max value $31,000 but shooting for a double bagger. Netflix tends to run in the direction it popped in, win or lose so I'll probably hold a bit assuming it does well.

My case : AD REVENUE!

Netflix is very likely to report good things about the current and future success of the ad options. Account sharing crackdown is nice but I'm mainly counting on a solid beat and revenue guidance.

I'm confident in my bull case but this is 100% yolo - not a recommendation like TRV. I AM NOT RECOMMENDING y'all tail. I'm definitely talking that shit if I win so I wanted to at least post my position first.

NFLX,wallstreetbets,Why I don't think NVDA party gonna last,"I know I know - you all think NVDA can reach higher than the sky, but here is why I say they don't. In fact, here is why I say they have already outburnt their rocket!  
Look at the list below.   
there are only 5 companies at the $1T club, and number 6 and 7 are fighting their asses off to get in. now lets talk about ALL of them, and why NVDA isn't one of them:  


1. MSFT has just this week gained supremacy and passed AAPL. There's no argue why MSFT is one of the top 5 companies in the world. They control more than 60% of all OS on all computers on the entire planet, they have access to us all with their products, and they control 22% of could services world wide with Azure. billions of users world wide uses products they 100% own, and profit of with no middleman anywhere. That's dominancy! That's not talking about LinkedIn which is considered to be the best professional social network, and they sure as fuck monetize this.
2. AAPL since they dropped Intel's processors for the M1 and later M2, they control end-to-end of their production process and have roughly 50% market share of wealthy users world wide, plus 26% of mobile users globally. Not sure if they truly invented it, but they have perfected the subscription profit model, and controlling the spending of their huge users base fiercely! And I bet there's a hidden report out there showing they control the majority of the top dome of socio-economic group. BTW a friend of mine working as senior full stack at MSFT told me they gave him a MacBook when he started working for Microsoft. He's developing MS-Office on a MacBook!!!!! 
3. Saudi-Aramco - I know shit about them, but they control oceans of oil and you know.... oil is oil
4. Google - 98% market share for online searches. plus, over 70% global market share of mobile OS and 12% share of  cloud service. All in-house and 100% owned by Google. Oh yeah, and don't forget about Youtube. Oh BTW - do you drive much? did you know that to avoid competition, Google bought Waze too?
5. AMZN - Well to be honest, I don't believe they have a strong valuable market place anymore and I am pessimistic about their retailing now days. In fact I heard somewhere (and I can't find it now) that they lost almost $10B on their forward sellings in 2022, BUT!!!! they earned over $20B off advertising on site which covers the returns and customer's care. we can argue about that, but we can't argue about the crown jewel of AMZN - AWS!!!! 33% of all data on could, is located on an AWS server. You know NFLX, DIS, and WBD streaming services? Along with Amazon prime, they are all located on the same fucking servers!!!! In fact, unless you're watching Youtube or AppleTV, if you're watching streamers, you're watching it off an AWS server! 
6. NVDA - let's roll back to it later
7. Meta - I do hate that evil empire, but there's no argue that there's no other company with as much user data as they have. Between Instagram, Facebook, whatsapp - if you want to talk or meet someone, it's probably through one of their platforms, and they monitor it.
8. Tesla - I hate Elon! I think he should be in jail for violating at least 10 SEC regulations. But he's still out there and roaming. I won't argue that TSLA is A-Z solution to car manufacturing. Everything is In-house as well, and the marketing expenses are 0!!! But in a world where everybody are looking for autonomous vehicles, Elon's got the most data collected in the world. When they talked about creating a center control for autonomous driving, they suggested Tesla will be the center since they have the biggest data centers dedicated for it. 

&#x200B;

Now lets get back to NVDA - 10 years ago, they were nothing. A great product for a special segment of hardcore computer users willing to spend $200-$500 on hardware no one else even knows needed.  
Back then Intel was God and AMD tried biting on them. But got no where close.   
Then AI kicked in, and engineers found out GPU are better to teach the modules rather than CPU and guess who's the best GPU manufacturer? wait no!!! It's not NVDA! They have never manufactured a single processor. They don't have a single factory. They do it all with TSMC (number 11 on the list, but around 1/3 the value on NVDA). 

Ok so they have the best design. Fuck!!! no they don't!! They use ARM technology to design their processors ($74B market cap). And why ARM are so important? well because couple months ago, NVDA wanted to buy them, so the US regulator looked this deal up, and found out these 2 companies are the only 2 companies to design such technologies and by buying them, NVDA will basically eliminate the competition, and be a full monopoly on ARM architecture processors. so how come one company is worth $74B and the other $1.4T??? because they design the best AI training processors.

WAIT!!!! FUCK they don't!!!!! haven't you heard?? AMD just steamrolled them with Frontier ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontier\_(supercomputer)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontier_(supercomputer)))  


AMD has had the best week in their life!! how good? $250B good. That's still 1/6 of NVDA.  
And wait, I mentioned Intel several times before, but what's the deal with them? Well in a nut shell, they have dragged behind. They used to have an enormous market share of processors in the market and they got cocky and neglected R&D while the rest rushed to innovate. But even though you are probably reading this on an Intel based computer, or have one at work/home, and they used to be the sole suppliers for Apple computers, Intel at it's peak was worth $273B (Jan 31st 2020). Still fraction of NVDA's worth. And in opposed to NVDA, ARM and AMD - Intel has always owned their own factories, meaning their worth should combine NVDA and TSMC together!!!!

So the question remains - WTF??????

NFLX,wallstreetbets,Sound Investment Symphony: Why $SPOT is Tuned for a Bullish Crescendo in 2023,"Spotify Technology is a Swedish audio streaming giant – clear market leader in audio streaming industry. Its catalogue consists of music, podcasts and most lately - audiobooks. 

Spotify is commonly paralleled with Netflix ($NFLX) – video streaming powerhouse – as their business model presents to be very similar. But they differ in one great point:

Spotify and other rivals such as Apple Music, Youtube Music, Amazon Music do not compete with content like Netflix does with the likes of HBO and Disney. Music streaming platforms all offer the same content, while competing on overall user experience and additional features e.g. Spotify’s Podcasts and Audiobooks for its Premium users.

&#x200B;

**Micro stock price picture**

$SPOT last closing price was at $170.98 USD which is significantly up this year as it amounts to an almost 117% YTD return. For comparison, NASDAQ gained 32% in that period while the share price of French competitor Deezer lost almost 12%. Comparable IT companies such as $SHOP, $ROKU and $NFLX gained 77%, 100% and 52% YTD respectively.

&#x200B;

**Macro stock price picture**

Even though $SPOT more than doubled its stock price this year, share price still visibly lags behind the post-covid highs of north of $350 USD per share even considering the pandemic did not have substantial negative effects on the Swedish music streaming giant.

Additionally, $SPOT current price is just slightly up (\~3%) from its IPO price of $165,90 USD back in the April 2018. In the meantime, Spotify Technology steadily accumulated more than 400 million additional monthly active users (up 237%), more than 150 additional Premium subscribers (up 201%) and more than $2B in quarterly revenue (up 194%).

Based on nasdaq.com, the average price target for $SPOT is set at $188.39 USD (up 10%) while Wells Fargo analyst Steven Cahall set the price target at $250 USD (up 46%). Overall analyst consensus based on 29 analyst recommendations is Strong Buy.

**Underperforming Earnings – Not Anymore!**

In the last couple of years, Spotify’s Earning calls consistently excelled in user specific metrics such as MAUs and Premium subscribers, while financial metrics like Total Revenue and Net Income did not impress investors. The root cause was a weak Gross Margin which is due to the nature of the Music Streaming business – the bedrock of Spotify’s product catalogue. Most of the music revenue received from Premium and Ad Supported users is distributed to the three major record labels which leaves no room for profitability. 

By adding podcasts and recently audiobooks, Spotify transformed itself from a music platform to an audio platform, which also brought improvements in company’s profitability. On the last Earnings Call on 24th of October 2023, Spotify reported a surprise profit of 32 million € (45 million loss expected) while Gross Margin amounted to 26.4% (26.0% expected). 

On Earnings Call Spotify’s CFO added that in terms of profitability, $SPOT reached an inflection point while also stating encouraging outlooks for the next quarter. It is also worth adding the efforts in cost cutting activities which also attributed to positive P&L results.

The stock surged following the earnings call, up as much as 11% in early trading.

&#x200B;

**TL; DR** 

$SPOT – currently up 3% from its IPO price while performance metrics more than doubled – is poised for a bull run based on reported and future profits.

Its catalogue consists of music, podcasts and most lately - audiobooks. 

Spotify is commonly paralleled with Netflix ($NFLX) – video streaming powerhouse – as their business model presents to be very similar. But they differ in one great point:

Spotify and other rivals such as Apple Music, Youtube Music, Amazon Music do not compete with content like Netflix does with the likes of HBO and Disney. Music streaming platforms all offer the same content, while competing on overall user experience and additional features e.g. Spotify’s Podcasts and Audiobooks for its Premium users.

&#x200B;

**Micro stock price picture**

$SPOT last closing price was at $170.98 USD which is significantly up this year as it amounts to an almost 117% YTD return. For comparison, NASDAQ gained 32% in that period while the share price of French competitor Deezer lost almost 12%. Comparable IT companies such as $SHOP, $ROKU and $NFLX gained 77%, 100% and 52% YTD respectively.

**Macro stock price picture**

Even though $SPOT more than doubled its stock price this year, share price still visibly lags behind the post-covid highs of north of $350 USD per share even considering the pandemic did not have substantial negative effects on the Swedish music streaming giant.

Additionally, $SPOT current price is just slightly up (\~3%) from its IPO price of $165,90 USD back in the April 2018. In the meantime, Spotify Technology steadily accumulated more than 400 million additional monthly active users (up 237%), more than 150 additional Premium subscribers (up 201%) and more than $2B in quarterly revenue (up 194%).

In connection with the above-described measures, in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 the Company expects to record an impairment charge in a preliminary estimated range of $160 million to $200 million related to ceasing to use certain office facilities and an impairment charge in a preliminary estimated range of $55 million to $65 million related to removing select existing licensed and produced content from Company-operated services on its TV streaming platform. The Company does not expect any material cash expenditures in connection with the impairment charge related to content.

* Platform revenue was $744 million in Q2, up 11% YoY. We generate Platform revenue primarily from the sale of digital advertising (including media and entertainment promotional spending, the demand-side Platform , and related services), as well as content distribution services (such as subscription and transaction revenue shares, and the sale of Premium Subscriptions). ARPU was $40.67 (on a trailing 12-month basis), down 7% YoY. This decline was due to strong global Active Account growth outpacing Platform revenue growth.While Q2 Platform revenue exceeded our expectations, the macro environment continued to create uncertainty with the total U.S. advertising market remaining flat YoY in Q2. Ad spend on traditional TV declined 9.4% YoY, and traditional TV ad scatter was down 17.2% YoY (according to SMI). Consistent with Q2 industry trends, brand advertising on the Roku platform remained pressured YoY in verticals like technology and M&E (media and entertainment) which was offset by increasing spend from important categories like CPG (consumer packaged goods) and health and wellness. Also, the macro uncertainty has impacted the timing of Upfront negotiations, with commitments proceeding at a slower pace across the industry.

   * ""Madison Avenue pulled hundreds of millions of dollars out of primetime TV and sent them to streaming venues in the industry’s recently completed “upfront” market, the latest sign that one of the media sector’s most stable mediums is in an era of severe flux.""

**Warning:**

* Roku previously raised guidance for Q3:  Excluding charges related to items such as severance and the removal of select content from its streaming platform, Roku now expects third-quarter net revenue in the range of $835 million to $875 million, with adjusted EBITDA in the range of negative $40 million to negative $20 million. This is ahead of its previous Q3 forecast for revenue of roughly $815 million and adjusted EBITDA of negative $50 million.
* Large insider transactions but many of them appear to be related to repositioning from personal ownership to trust ownership and vis versa.

**Customers and Revenue Streams:**

* Consumers purchase Roku branded/distributed TV and home entertainment devices. Roku sells most of their hardware at cost. Roku provides consumers the ability to watch: ad-supported video on demand, live TV, and subscription based content.
* TV Manufacturers pay a licensing fee for every TV that uses Roku OS (fee is incurred when TV is sold and activated via internet connection).
* Content Providers pay Roku in multiple ways:
   * Commissions for each subscription purchased on a Roku TV
      * Apple TV raising prices, starting October 25 2023
      * Discovery Plus raising prices, starting November 3 2023
      * AMC Plus launching discounted ad supported service starting in Q3/Q4 2023
      * Disney+ raising prices, starting October 12 2023
      * Hulu raising prices, starting October 12 2023.
      * Paramount+ raised prices on July 27 2023
      * Peacock raised prices on July 18 2023
      * Starz raised prices starting July 2023
      * Average price increase is about 15%. However, this is not very helpful because Roku does not break down the proportion of Platform Revenue that is related to advertising and subscription commissions. My best guess is that 97.5 million of Roku's revenue comes from subscriptions. This is based off the language in the last quarterly filing that said stronger subscription revenue offset a loss in advertising revenue for certain segments. We can gut check this by comparing this number to the number of users/TV sold, a reasonable conversion rate, and an average streaming cost of $8 per month or $24 per quarter with 20% commission given to Roku. Given the roughly 100,000,000 Roku platform TVs currently active this would mean Roku would need a 2% conversion rate. Meaning 2% of customers who bought a TV with the Roku platform used the Roku TV to subscribe to a service. (I have no idea how this industry works, I'm on WSB, but that conversion rate seems reasonable). So the price hikes would likely only add \~14.625 million to Roku's revenue in Q4 2023 with a small amount captured in Q3 2023. If you want to ""massage"" the numbers, if you assume a 2% conversion rate you could see an additional $29.25 million in revenue every quarter for Roku due to price hikes. That would nearly put adjusted EBITDA guidance (not including restructuring) for 2023 in positive territory which investors will certainty like.

**Historical Financials and Estimates:**

* You can use Google for the details, regard. Search ""Roku revenue breakdown"" or use Google Finance.

**Related Companies:**

* Vizio, Fubo, Amazon (Streaming), Disney (Streaming), Comcast (Streaming), Other Streaming Companies. I know I am missing a few here.

**Some Revenue Calculations:**

Roku gets a 20% commission on the majority of subscriptions made through the Roku platform. Amazon Prime and Netflix do not pay this commission. If we can determine the number of subscribers the streaming companies added in Q3 and then assume 5% of those subscribers did so via a Roku TV then we can combine that with pricing information to estimate a portion of Roku's revenue. 5% is on the low end, some outdated sources said as many as 27% of sign ups happen through the Roku platform - but I doubt it is that high. I also use 1.5 months assuming a constant rate of sign up throughout the quarter for each service.

* Peacock was a bright spot for Comcast in Q3, adding 4 million subscribers in the quarter and taking the total to 28 million paid customers, roughly 80% higher than a year ago. Higher pricing for the streaming service also boosted revenue to $830 million, a 64% increase from the prior-year quarter.
   * 5% of subscribers through Roku
   * $5.99 per month low tier
   * 1.5 months
   * 4,000,000 x 0.05 x 5.99 x 1.5 = 1,797,000 in growth revenue
* Hulu added 100,000 subscribers in Q3:
   * 5% of subscribers through Roku
   * $8 per month low tier
   * 1.5 months
   * 100,000 x 0.05 x 8 x 1.5 = 60,000
* Paramount+ added 700,000 subscribers in Q3:
   * 5% of subscribers through Roku
   * $6 per month low tier
   * 1.5 months
   * 700,000 x 0.05 x 6 x 1.5 = 315,000
* Apple TV added \~400,000 subscribers in Q3
   * 5% of subscribers through Roku
   * $7 per month low tier
   * 1.5 months
   * 400,000 x 0.05 x 7 x 1.5 = 210,000
* **This only gets us about 2.4 million in new revenue from Q2. But notably this is only a portion of the subscription commission revenue and does not include any increase or decrease in advertising revenue. Need to do more calculations. I would welcome any help.**

**Thesis / Conclusion:**

Roku will:

* Beat on active users and hours watched through Roku because:
   * Netflix crackdown
   * International expansion
   * Low cost products, a purchase of a cheap TV is an investment into cheaper entertainment
* Beat on device sales because:
   * International expansion
   * Consumers worldwide are moving towards cheaper products

* Report revenue of $865 million because:
   * General strength in advertising industry: AMZN reported massive ad revenue/growth after GOOG, META, SPOT, NFLX, etc.
   * Some price increases will be captured in Q3
   * The Amazon password sharing crackdown may have caused people to sign up to commission paying services through a Roku TV.
* Revenue guidance may be increased higher and a wider range because:
   * Uncertainty on how price hikes will impact subscriptions
   * Uncertainty on whether the resilience and change to stream based advertising spending will continue to beat out linear advertising (traditional TV).
* EPS is tricky but I believe it will beat on an adjusted EBITDA basis if certain severance payments from layoffs are not included. How they exclude or include restructuring costs in EDBITDA will be key. This goes for any future EPS forecasts as well.",20,26,1698370278.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/17hc9j6/preliminary_dd_roku/,Kindly_ReImagination,"Preliminary DD: ROKU So this is far from complete but I'm a regard and playing Roku earnings.

**Historical Financials and Estimates:**

* You can use Google for the details, regard. Search ""Roku revenue breakdown"" or use Google Finance.

**Related Companies:**

* Vizio, Fubo, Amazon (Streaming), Disney (Streaming), Comcast (Streaming), Other Streaming Companies. I know I am missing a few here.

**Some Revenue Calculations:**

Roku gets a 20% commission on the majority of subscriptions made through the Roku platform. Amazon Prime and Netflix do not pay this commission. If we can determine the number of subscribers the streaming companies added in Q3 and then assume 5% of those subscribers did so via a Roku TV then we can combine that with pricing information to estimate a portion of Roku's revenue. 5% is on the low end, some outdated sources said as many as 27% of sign ups happen through the Roku platform - but I doubt it is that high. I also use 1.5 months assuming a constant rate of sign up throughout the quarter for each service.

* Peacock was a bright spot for Comcast in Q3, adding 4 million subscribers in the quarter and taking the total to 28 million paid customers, roughly 80% higher than a year ago. Higher pricing for the streaming service also boosted revenue to $830 million, a 64% increase from the prior-year quarter.
   * 5% of subscribers through Roku
   * $5.99 per month low tier
   * 1.5 months
   * 4,000,000 x 0.05 x 5.99 x 1.5 = 1,797,000 in growth revenue
* Hulu added 100,000 subscribers in Q3:
   * 5% of subscribers through Roku
   * $8 per month low tier
   * 1.5 months
   * 100,000 x 0.05 x 8 x 1.5 = 60,000
* Paramount+ added 700,000 subscribers in Q3:
   * 5% of subscribers through Roku
   * $6 per month low tier
   * 1.5 months
   * 700,000 x 0.05 x 6 x 1.5 = 315,000
* Apple TV added \~400,000 subscribers in Q3
   * 5% of subscribers through Roku
   * $7 per month low tier
   * 1.5 months
   * 400,000 x 0.05 x 7 x 1.5 = 210,000
* **This only gets us about 2.4 million in new revenue from Q2. But notably this is only a portion of the subscription commission revenue and does not include any increase or decrease in advertising revenue. Need to do more calculations. I would welcome any help.**

**Thesis / Conclusion:**

Roku will:

* Beat on active users and hours watched through Roku because:
   * Netflix crackdown
   * International expansion
   * Low cost products, a purchase of a cheap TV is an investment into cheaper entertainment
* Beat on device sales because:
   * International expansion
   * Consumers worldwide are moving towards cheaper products

* Report revenue of $865 million because:
   * General strength in advertising industry: AMZN reported massive ad revenue/growth after GOOG, META, SPOT, NFLX, etc.
   * Some price increases will be captured in Q3
   * The Amazon password sharing crackdown may have caused people to sign up to commission paying services through a Roku TV.
* Revenue guidance may be increased higher and a wider range because:
   * Uncertainty on how price hikes will impact subscriptions
   * Uncertainty on whether the resilience and change to stream based advertising spending will continue to beat out linear advertising (traditional TV).
* EPS is tricky but I believe it will beat on an adjusted EBITDA basis if certain severance payments from layoffs are not included. How they exclude or include restructuring costs in EDBITDA will be key. This goes for any future EPS forecasts as well.",0.9977,Positive
NFLX,wallstreetbets,"META Earnings Today, why not grab calls?","Bullish on META ahead of Earnings

Meta Platforms (META) is scheduled to report its fiscal Q3 2023 results today. Last quarter, they kicked ass with 11% YoY revenue gains, hitting a cool $32 billion. Daily active users and ad impressions? Up 5% and 34%, respectively. But hold on—average price-per-ad fell 16% YoY. Expecting similar vibes this quarter, but what's the play?

Let's rewind a bit. META stock was a rollercoaster—up 15% from early 2021, sitting pretty at $310. But it wasn’t smooth sailing, folks. We saw +23% in 2021, a bloodbath of -64% in 2022, and then a moonshot of +156% in 2023. In comparison, returns for the S&P 500 have been 27% in 2021, -19% in 2022, and 10% in 2023 - indicating that META underperformed the S&P in 2021 and 2022. In fact, consistently beating the S&P 500 - in good times and bad - has been difficult over recent years for individual stocks; for other heavyweights in the Communication Services sector including GOOG, NFLX, and CMCSA, and even for the megacap stars TSLA, MSFT, and AMZN. It's like they're playing catch up.

Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment with high oil prices and elevated interest rates, could META face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a strong jump?

Well considering this year has been the 'year of efficiency' for Meta Platforms, with the company’s quarterly results in 2023 regularly bringing fireworks post-earnings. I'm certainly bullish. During the earnings, I will be interested in the company’s Reality Labs performance, a segment that includes Meta’s augmented and virtual reality related consumer hardware, software, and content. The segment has come under scrutiny in the past following concerns about its profitability. However, analysts are expecting growth with this segment.

Any losses from it's virtual reality will be a drop in the bucket anyways as META's main money maker is advertising. So I'll also be watching for active user growth. Meta's ad growth is expected to spike 25% yoy in the third quarter and through 2024 with rising Reels engagement and monetization. However we should keep an eye on ""paid social"" as a new form of revenue (subscriptions).

Despite the details, I think it's worth getting a call for META before earnings. I'm going to grab META 10/24 320c @ 5.75.

NFLX,wallstreetbets,Funds were waiting for earnings to justify EOY rally. Taking bullish hedges.,"Looking at MSFT balance sheet (I don't care about expectation numbers), gross profit is slowing down, this is consistent with slowing economic factors. I am a big ol' rainbow bear but have stayed out of most bearish positions for earnings.

I wanted to see the mountain of NVDA chip expenses show up on the balance sheet but I don't see it. Total expenses is up almost jack shit YoY. Anywho, NVDAs gap fill day will come due. However, there is no way you can take bearish positions from here on M7. Maybe im bad at reading these fuckers and its under assets, idc anyway.

MSFT balance sheet looks decent. NFLX responded well. AAPL might miss because of china, but NVDA can definitely pull one more dirty trick up its sleeve at least. Black rock probably put out some crazy article to pump NVDA to the moon. If you want bull capitulation for the highest volatility, you need an M7 miss across the board. Interest on cash of some of these companies are going to soften expenses.

Were going to need to see revenue from credit cards peak and plateu and lets student loans/oil do its thing. Once the loans (company loans) roll over to higher interest rate, then we can get something. Companies will show growth consistent with inflation, but MSFT's growth outpaces inflation for this earnings, and that has to justify a uptrend after a beat down.

Mid 2024 puts, 2025 puts if you want to be a bear right now. Failed breakdown happened. Big bears might come back for government shut-down. Call city for christmas. Put city for 2024. It's just that simple.  If you dont pick up some calls, you too bearish. Or dont do anything, this is not financial advice. VM better not talk shit.

I'm currently looking for bearish positions in DIA and IWM. Mainly because no one has any talent anymore for value stocks and they all just going to swarm into M7 anyway. Sell value for M7 is the way apparently.

NFLX,wallstreetbets,Some Thoughts on the Uranium Theme!,"As the market remains choppy with very few trending industries and prominent setups I had some time to really flush out my thoughts on one of the only industries that has had relative strength through the past few months of choppiness. This industry is Uranium!

Current Market Environment:
I don’t have any conviction in whether the market will move in a certain direction. With negative global sentiment (Isreal-Palestine tensions) and (Ukriane-Russia conflict) I truly don’t know what to expect from this market. As of today, October 15, 2023, there will be some big names (TSLA, BAC, NFLX) announcing earnings next week. This could shift sentiment as well but as of right now, I don’t have an opinion on this. One other thing to note is that the futures market is predicting that the next Fed meeting will likely result in the interest rate remaining unchanged at 94% probability. I think with better-than-expected earnings, and positive speeches from J.Powell and other Fed members we could see a small move up but only time will tell. The current market environment remains choppy at best!

Uranium Breakout Setups:
As of right now, I am seeing 4 main tickers emerging within the uranium industry. They are…
1. LEU 
2. UEC 
4. EU 

The reason these 4, to me, have potential is for a few reasons…
- Significant 1st leg up moves with $EU moving 30%, $UEC moving 60%, and $LEU moving 70%, before there current consolidation period
- They all have high Average Daily Range Percentages (ADR%) with the lowest one being from $EU which has a 5.5% ADR
- Tight ranges/ consolidation periods - Every one of these names has a pullback and continues to form a tight range

Other names in the industry such as UUUU, CCJ, NXE, DNN, UROY are either too choppy for my liking or they have fallen out of trend at the time of posting.

It’s interesting to note, that the price of Uranium ($UX - Uranium Futures) had large price increases right before these setups occurred. We currently have just seen uranium prices shoot up again while also hitting decade-long highs.

With respect to fundamentals, I don’t think I have the knowledge to really talk about the supply and demand components of uranium. That said, I have seen a handful of analysts express interest in the uranium sector.

Conclusion:
In summary, if you are a trend-following trader, uranium names should be on your watchlist! They may need a few more days of consolidation but they could move at any time. If however, a handful of names start breaking down, I will be more cautious on trading the uranium theme.

NFLX,wallstreetbets,"If you think SAG will get what they're asking for, Short NFLX","I am in the industry fwiw.  Hypothetically,  Netflix (NFLX) could be left in a rather precarious position, should  the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) emerge victorious from their prolonged  clash and attain their sought-after objectives. The core issue that  beckons our contemplation is the foreseen escalation in production  costs, a consequence of SAG's potentially successful campaign for  enhanced compensation and improved working conditions for thespian  talents.  

The heart of Netflix's allure resides in its prolific creation  of original content. It's an arena where they have staked a substantial  claim, consistently wowing audiences with a diverse array of offerings.  However, if SAG's demands are met, this narrative could alter  significantly.  

Picture a scenario where the payout to writers significantly  inflates, and the benchmarks for working conditions become loftier. The  immediate consequence is an augmentation in production expenses that  could spiral out of control.   

Now, let's dissect the repercussions of these burgeoning costs:  

   **Margin Squeeze**: A ballooning budget for content production  is likely to exert immense pressure on Netflix's profit margins. As they  strive to satiate the demands of both shareholders and content-hungry  subscribers, there might be a disconcerting erosion of profitability.  

   **Competitive Stagnation:** In the intensely competitive arena  of streaming, where Netflix faces a relentless barrage from Amazon Prime  Video, Disney+, HBO Max, and a host of other contenders, a sudden surge  in production costs could leave Netflix lagging in the race. To secure  and retain subscribers, they'd be constrained in their ability to offer  competitive pricing or to fund further innovative content.  This hits affects NFLX disproportionately because streaming is their Only Business; furthermore, they rely on newly-produced original content to a greater degree than other services.

   **Quality Conundrum:** Netflix's brand has been inexorably tied  to the quality of its original productions. If SAG's victory  necessitates budgetary restraint, the perilous question emerges: can  they sustain the caliber of content that has endeared them to  subscribers worldwide? A decline in quality could precipitate viewer  dissatisfaction and attrition.  

Let us foster discourse and exchange perspectives, for it is in  the crucible of collective intellect that we may glean the most  sagacious insights. However, heed this counsel: consult a financial sage  or undertake exhaustive research before embarking on any investment odyssey.

Picture a scenario where the payout to writers significantly  inflates, and the benchmarks for working conditions become loftier. The  immediate consequence is an augmentation in production expenses that  could spiral out of control.   

Now, let's dissect the repercussions of these burgeoning costs:  

   **Margin Squeeze**: A ballooning budget for content production  is likely to exert immense pressure on Netflix's profit margins. As they  strive to satiate the demands of both shareholders and content-hungry  subscribers, there might be a disconcerting erosion of profitability.  

   **Competitive Stagnation:** In the intensely competitive arena  of streaming, where Netflix faces a relentless barrage from Amazon Prime  Video, Disney+, HBO Max, and a host of other contenders, a sudden surge  in production costs could leave Netflix lagging in the race. To secure  and retain subscribers, they'd be constrained in their ability to offer  competitive pricing or to fund further innovative content.  This hits affects NFLX disproportionately because streaming is their Only Business; furthermore, they rely on newly-produced original content to a greater degree than other services.

   **Quality Conundrum:** Netflix's brand has been inexorably tied  to the quality of its original productions. If SAG's victory  necessitates budgetary restraint, the perilous question emerges: can  they sustain the caliber of content that has endeared them to  subscribers worldwide? A decline in quality could precipitate viewer  dissatisfaction and attrition.  

Let us foster discourse and exchange perspectives, for it is in  the crucible of collective intellect that we may glean the most  sagacious insights. However, heed this counsel: consult a financial sage  or undertake exhaustive research before embarking on any investment odyssey. Discuss.",0.9868,Positive
NFLX,wallstreetbets,Netflix trying to push it's subscribers to an ad-based model is a bad sign,"Recently Netflix announced an ad-based tier that is 55% cheaper than it's standard tier, and after failing to get more than 2% of it its users to join it, it caved and lowered the price from $7.99 to $6.99

**My opinion:** the fact that Netflix has introduced ads at all is a death knell for its business, at least as far as future growth is concerned.

The whole point of Netflix from the beginning was to escape the ad-based TV model. It offered a subscription instead, so you could watch whatever you wanted in peace, whenever/wherever you wanted. It enjoyed incredible growth for years since it essentially had found a way to declare open season on cable companies, etc. and feast on its market share. And feast it has.

But Netflix has ultimately become a victim of its own success - having seemingly hit a ceiling on its subscriber base (I mean how many households *dont* have Netflix?) and with tons of other companies now competing in the space, it's realizing that the only way to grow revenue from this point on isn't to increase the revenue generated from subscriptions (it can't, unless it wants to raise prices - which thanks to all the competition, would be a horrible move and cause further loss in users) but to increase the value of **viewing time** that each show/movie gets.

**For example:** I have a Netflix subscription and pay $15/month. Right now I can sit down in front of my TV and literally watch 10 movies in a row. I can watch movies and shows ALL DAY LONG, but Netflix doesn't reap any added benefit the more movies I watch. Whether I watch 2 hours of tv per week or 20, I'm still only giving Netflix the $15/month. It's an amazing deal for me, and that's why Netflix (and many other streaming services) are so popular. Woohoo!

But since **Netflix has hit a ceiling in subscriber growth**, they're realizing that if they want to avoid essentially becoming a utility company, they now need to somehow **increase the value of the minutes watched**. And the only way to do this - you guessed it - is to pump ads into all the shows and movies.

Great, so Netflix has begun solving one of their revenue growth problems. How is this a death knell for Netflix?

**Answer:** don't you get it? Netflix has failed to come up with any solutions to their stalling subscriber growth, to the point that they are willing to start *going backwards* and become the very thing they once hated. They are giving in and realizing that they now just have to become more like cable - blasting ads in between all of their content - to not stagnate in revenue.

Netflix is basically shouting ""We have given up - we are finally forced to admit that our business model is flawed, and that we now must become more like cable/a glorified youtube app - the very thing we once set out to overcome.""

Unsurprisingly, less than 3% of their users have agreed to fall for this new strategy and join the blast-me-in-the-face-with-ads plan.

**TLDR:** NFLX r fuk

**Positions:** I have 1 put contract on Netflix because I am poor. $310 by next January. I'm hoping NFLX stock prices decreases over the next 2-3 months especially if they get fucked by the unions and end up offering revenue share with their workers. Will sell when NFLX is below $400 and run away with a small profit to spend on shitty blow.

**PS:** Why the *fuck* has NFLX stock risen so much recently despite continuously reporting a slowdown in its revenue growth (quickly approaching the deadly 0%) ?

NFLX,wallstreetbets,roku thesis for friend,"Roku, a key player in the streaming industry, has shown promising performance in Q1 2023, with a noteworthy reduction in operating losses to $212.5 million. Moreover, in Q1 2023, Roku posted revenues of $740.99 million, a slight increase of 0.99% when compared to the same quarter in the previous year.

In terms of user growth, the company added 1.6 million active streaming accounts in Q1 2023, pushing the total active accounts to 71.6 million. Furthermore, Roku has forecasted a net revenue of $770 million for Q2 2023.

In the realm of market analysis, the consensus rating for Roku is ""Hold"". The mean price target for Roku's stock is $71.04, signifying an upside potential of 4.53%, with projections ranging from a high of $115 to a low of $41.

Considering these performance metrics and market expectations, we can develop a bullish thesis for Roku's next earnings call. This thesis is built around several key factors:

**Growing Popularity and Subscriber Base**: Roku's Smart TV operating system is gaining popularity and the company added 1.6 million new active accounts in Q1 2023. This is a clear indicator that the company's user base is on the rise and reflects the growing demand for streaming services.

**Improved Financial Performance**: Roku's ability to trim operating losses showcases the company's effective expense management. This is an indication that Roku is optimizing its operations and has a potential pathway to profitability.

**Competitive Features**: Roku's offerings are impressive, providing a good balance of cost and performance. For instance, the 55r6a5r model supports all HDR formats, has a quantum dot layer for enhanced color performance, and runs on the Linux-based Roku OS.

**Price Point and Color Accuracy**: Roku TVs offer a good balance between cost and performance. The QLED TVs provide a vibrant yet accurate color range, and they cover 96% of the Rec 709 color space and 80% of Rec 2020.

**Brightness**: Roku's model 55r6a5r is capable of hitting 500 nits in peak brightness, which is a significant improvement over TVs in the same price range.

**User Interface**: Roku's user interface is simple, easy to navigate, and doesn't bombard users with ads. This is one of its greatest strengths.

**Potential for Market Expansion**: If Roku can successfully penetrate the higher price band, there's potential for them to move into the premium segment.

**Positive Revenue Projection**: Roku's positive revenue forecast of $770 million for Q2 2023 indicates confidence in its business model and revenue generation capabilities.

**Potential Upside in Stock Price**: The current consensus analyst rating for Roku is ""Hold"", but the high-end prediction for Roku's stock price is $115. This signals a significant upside potential.

However, potential downsides include the limited number of zones in their 55r6a5r model leading to noticeable haloing or glowing around bright elements, the lack of support for 120Hz refresh rates and variable refresh rate features for gaming, and the requirement to create a Roku account to activate the TV.

An addendum that incorporates some extra key points:

**Private Listening Features**: One of the unique selling points of Roku is its private listening feature available through their phone app and some of the remotes. This feature allows users to plug into their device for a personalized listening experience, proving especially useful for those living in shared spaces or households with different sleep schedules.

**Roku OS on Affordable TVs**: Many sub-$500 TVs run on Roku OS, illustrating the popularity of Roku's software in the budget segment. This allows Roku to capture a significant segment of the market that seeks affordable smart TVs without compromising on the quality of the streaming experience.

**Roku Stick and Boxes**: Consumers often pair Roku's external devices, such as sticks and boxes, with high-end TVs from manufacturers like Samsung, whose inbuilt Smart TV features may not meet user expectations or may deteriorate over time. Roku's standalone devices offer consistent performance and an intuitive user interface, which increases their appeal to users looking for a reliable streaming solution.

**User-Friendly Interface**: Roku's easy-to-navigate interface with large buttons and voice-activated remote control is user-friendly, making it a popular choice among people of all ages, including older adults who may not be as tech-savvy. This ease of use and simplicity has been a major factor contributing to Roku's growth and reputation.

**Regular Updates**: Unlike many manufacturers of budget TVs and set-top boxes, Roku is known for providing regular software updates. This commitment to maintaining a reliable, up-to-date user experience is another factor contributing to Roku's popularity.

**Manufacturer Adoption**: From a manufacturer's perspective, adopting Roku's operating system is more convenient and cost-effective than developing, updating, and supporting their own software. This ease of integration has led to Roku OS being adopted in a wide range of devices, from budget to high-end TVs, further expanding Roku's market presence.

In summary, these factors enhance the value proposition of Roku's products and services, attracting a broad user base and fueling its growth in the competitive streaming market.

* **Historical Move v Implied Move:** We determine the historical volatility (log variance of daily gains) of the underlying asset (HV) and compare that to the current implied volatitlity (IV) of the option price. This is used to determine the Call or Put Premium.
* **Expiration:** 2023-05-26.
* **Call/Put Pricing:** How much extra you are paying for IV relative to HV. Low numbers mean ""cheaper."" High numbers mean ""expensive."" A 1 means ""fairly"" priced.
* **Efficiency:** This the bid/ask spreads and the depth of the order book relative to the price and approximates the cost of a round trip trade. Lower numbers are less efficient than higher numbers.
* **E.R.:** Days unitl the next Earnings Release.
* **Direction:** This ranges from -100 (bearish) to +100 (bullish). It accounts for RSI, trend, moving averages and put/call skew over the past 4 weeks.
* **Why isn't my stock on this list?** It doesn't have ""weeklies"", the underlying is ""too cheap"", or the options markets are too illiquid (open interest) to qualify for this strategy. 480 underlyings are used in this report and only the top results end up passing the criteria for each filter.
* **How should this be improved?** Do you have any suggestions or notice any bugs with this report?",20,8,1684849625.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/13pp270/best_options_report_for_5232023/,intraalpha,"Best Options report for 5/23/2023 [Option Summary](https://preview.redd.it/uuwcak0g5l1b1.png?width=3180&format=png&auto=webp&s=c737db1fa8b35285bd8d7d623c896dffbace88c6)

* **Historical Move v Implied Move:** We determine the historical volatility (log variance of daily gains) of the underlying asset and compare that to the current implied volatitlity (IV) of the option price. This is used to determine the Call or Put Premium associated with the pricing of options (implied volatility).
* **Priced Move:** given the current option prices, how much in dollar amounts will the underlying have to move to make the call/put break even. This is how much vol the option is pricing in. The expected move.
* **Expiration:** 2023-05-12.
* **Call/Put Premium:** How much extra you are paying for the implied move relative to the historic move. Low numbers mean options are ""cheaper."" High numbers mean options are ""expensive.""

NFLX,wallstreetbets,My lotto play for DIS's earnings tonight,"Disney is reporting it's fiscal second quarter earnings after the bell. I'm wondering if the media conglomerate can keep regaining its mojo with Disney shares up +13% year to date to top the S&P 500’s +8%.

Here are what analysts expect:

* Earnings per share: 93 cents per share expected, according to a [Refinitiv](https://www.refinitiv.com/) survey of analysts

* Revenue: $21.79 billion expected, according to Refinitiv

* Disney+ total subscriptions: 163.17 million expected, according to [StreetAccount](https://www.streetaccount.com/)

They're expecting a drop in Disney’s second-quarter earnings per share compared to the Q2 2022 EPS, but with Q2 sales up from the prior-year quarter. Investors will be hoping that Disney can post another better-than-expected quarter on its bottom line and show a consistent illustration that the company is working in the right direction to elevate its profitability margin despite what is still a challenging macroeconomic environment for most companies. 

Notably, Disney easily surpassed its Q1 EPS expectations by 43% last quarter. The earnings beat was driven by a 21% YoY increase in the Parks, Experiences, and Products segment revenue at $8.7 billion. This led to shares of DIS spiking more than 5% before cooling down and drifting lower in the following weeks. Certainly, more sustainability in Disney’s price movement after reporting its Q2 results is at focus in hopes that this year’s rally can be extended.

Beyond day-to-day operations at the company, we're going to expect Bob Iger (CEO of Disney) to address a number ongoing challenges. On Monday, Disney expanded its [federal lawsuit](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/26/disney-sues-florida-gov-ron-desantis-alleges-political-effort-to-hurt-its-business.html) against Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, accusing the Republican leader of doubling down on his “[retribution campaign](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/08/disney-lawsuit-against-desantis-expanded.html)” against the company by [signing legislation](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/05/desantis-signs-bill-to-void-disney-development-deals.html) to void Disney’s development deals in Orlando.

Additionally, the company is already [seeing rippling effects from the ongoing writers strike](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/08/hollywood-writers-strike-halts-stranger-things-severance-production.html), including the production shutdowns of Marvel Studios’ “Blade,” which was set to begin filming in Atlanta next month, as well as the Disney+ Star Wars series “Andor.”

**IGER & Cost Cutting**

In regard to Disney increasing its margins, Iger returned to the helm of the company last November with the initiative to reduce expenses and sustain growth and profitability.

During its last quarterly report and Iger’s first back as CEO, the Disney boss announced the company would cut thousands of jobs and reduce its capital expenditures by $5.5 billion. To the delight of investors, Iger stated the cost-cutting initiatives will make it possible for Disney’s board to approve the reinstatement of its dividend by the end of the year. We expect a third wave of layoffs within the company announced soon.

**Streaming Growth**

Like streaming competitor Netflix (NFLX), Disney will no longer provide guidance for subscriber growth. With that being said, Disney’s ability to add subscribers during the quarter will be at the forefront of its Q2 results.

Specifically, Wall Street is eyeing Disney+ after the streaming service lost 2.4 million subscribers during Q1 amid subscription price hikes and increasing competition from big-name tech stocks like AAPL, and AMZN. This was the firstly quarterly loss since Disney+ was launched in 2019. Still, a wider loss was expected among Disney+ subscribers last quarter with Disney topping estimates by 3%.

Disney+ had 161.8 million paid subscribers during Q1 and 234.7 million total subscribers when including its ESPN+ and Hulu services. While Disney’s total paid subscribers topped Netflix’s 232.5 million paying members, the company’s Direct to Consumer segment reported a -$1.1 billion loss during Q1 up from -$0.5 billion in the prior-year quarter.

Disney stated the increase in operating loss was due to a higher loss at Disney+ and a decrease in results at Hulu although there were improved results at ESPN+. Direct to Consumer revenue did increase by 13% YoY during Q1 to $5.3 billion.  

Improvement in operating costs among the Direct to Consumer segment will make Disney’s stock much more attractive. Longer-term investors are hoping that Disney’s growth among streaming services will eventually lead to massive earnings potential for the company.

**Earnings Expected Move**

Looking at the implied volatility of the options market in Disney, we can see the weekly expected move for the rest of the week is ±$3.55 - about 3.5% of the stock’s notional value. This is not too high of an expected move for an equity, but it is about 77% of the expected move through the June options cycle 39 days away from expiration, and over 50% of the expected move in the July options expiration cycle. Based on this information, the market is placing a lot of weight on Wednesday's earnings report, given the high implied volatility in the weekly cycle relative to further-dated cycles.

With DIS stock trading at $100.70 (at the time of writing this), we can go to equidistant out-of-the-money (OTM) strikes to see if there is a difference in premium, or skewed premium. Looking into the option chain, in this case, the calls is trading for a bit more than the puts, both 5 points OTM from the current stock price. This tells us that Disney’s options market has call skew in the weekly cycle. This indicates that a high velocity move is being priced into the upside – this does not mean the stock is going to go up, but the market is pricing in the risk of a high velocity move to the upside just slightly.

**What to do For Disney Earnings?**

I looked through the last 5 years of movements with earnings, the stock moves on average 4 ± 3% after the earnings report. With this said, it might not even be worth getting calls or puts because the premium prices are pricing a move that's very very similar to this percentage. However, given everything I've looked at, I want to get puts. DIS 5/12 99p is 2.03. However, I'll be inversing myself because of the WSB Cramer tag and will make big money with a call spread. I can buy the DIS 5/12 102c for $241 and sell the 105c for $140. This means I can grab the spread for $101, and potentially make 3x gains.

# Transaction Selection

1. **All** **Open Market Transactions** from **May 1st - May 5th.** These are Form 4 filings with a Transaction Code of “P” or “S”. This narrows the scope to trades where insiders are putting their money on the line.
2. **Both indirect and direct** transactions are included in the reports.
3. Weekly comparisons are to transactions from **April 24th - April 28th.**
4. **No companies without a ticker**
5. No penny stocks or banned tickers.

# Further Context

1. Form 4 data is impacted by a concept known as **backfill** which is par for the course with transactional data. The delay between the Filing Date and the Transaction Date is **\*roughly\*** 2 days and your mileage will vary. This means that **more transactions for past dates can arrive in future filings.** That is why looking at larger trends is key.
2. To combat backfill, filings through this Tuesday are included **\*if\*** the transaction date is from the prior week. Otherwise, transactions from this week are excluded.
3. Data is sourced by algos behind Form Fore

# Transaction Selection

1. **All** **Open Market Transactions** from **May 1st - May 5th.** These are Form 4 filings with a Transaction Code of “P” or “S”. This narrows the scope to trades where insiders are putting their money on the line.
2. **Both indirect and direct** transactions are included in the reports.
3. Weekly comparisons are to transactions from **April 24th - April 28th.**
4. **No companies without a ticker**
5. No penny stocks or banned tickers.

# Further Context

1. Form 4 data is impacted by a concept known as **backfill** which is par for the course with transactional data. The delay between the Filing Date and the Transaction Date is **\*roughly\*** 2 days and your mileage will vary. This means that **more transactions for past dates can arrive in future filings.** That is why looking at larger trends is key.
2. To combat backfill, filings through this Tuesday are included **\*if\*** the transaction date is from the prior week. Otherwise, transactions from this week are excluded.
3. Data is sourced by algos behind Form Fore

NFLX,wallstreetbets,Volume tickers in play,"Trading Thesis: Tracking the float along with daily volume along with company financials helps to narrow down moving tickers
Fundamental and technical analysis is often used to find growth tickers and information about them. Fundamental analysis looks to see whether an investment is overvalued or undervalued based on underlying economic conditions, as well as the finances of the company or other organization that issued a stock or bond. Technical analysis instead looks at patterns in the price of an investment to predict future movements in that investment’s price. 
I look for tickers that are trading at least 2 million in volume a day, with a market-cap of no less than 500 million. 
The shares traded are compared to the average volume to determine how much of the float is used (Or shares traded). That information is compiled with data on how profitable the company is and how much cash do they have compared to what is expected.

Things to consider when finding the plays-

·       If the stock volume has traded 1 million or more in volume premarket, I will use that and calculate a rough estimate on what the stock will trade for the day. 

·       If the ticker looks to be trading more volume than the day before, I will consider it for a long play. If trading less than the movement of the ticker, I would consider a short or put play.  (If all the other factors previously mentioned checks out.) 

·       The trades are researched afternoon daily to find possible tickers making a big move.

NFLX,wallstreetbets,EarningsGPT: This Week Earnings Releases and Reactions Summary by ChatGPT,"This is the results of a script that complies news articles discussing stocks with earnings this week. I scrapped articles analysing the last earnings report, and **asked ChatGPT to summarise key new information and how market reacted to the new release.**

Here are the results for this week biggest earnings.

&#x200B;

# LMT: Lockheed Martin Corp 

Lockheed Martin's Q1 results exceeded analysts' expectations, leading to a record high stock surge. Revenue rose by less than 1% to over $15 billion, but the company expects revenue to decline this year due to supply chain constraints. Lockheed saw a decline of 2% in its aeronautics revenue, primarily due to a backlog of F-35 fighter jets. However, the company gained a boost in contracts related to the war in Ukraine, expected to generate $1.5 billion in sales this year and up to $6 billion by 2027. The Chinese government has banned senior executives from Lockheed and Raytheon from entering, working, or residing in China, along with imports and exports related to China.

Lockheed Martin's stock rose by almost 2.5% on the day, and it is up by more than 3% year-to-date, showing that Wall Street is taking notice of the company. Investors are concerned about the China issue and the potential for decoupling from Chinese suppliers, leading to dependency on other sources. The next presidential election may focus on this issue, as both sides of the political spectrum agree that the US needs to decrease its dependence on China. Many industries, including technology, chips, and production, are dependent on China, and this issue is likely to resurface repeatedly in the near future.

&#x200B;

# GS: Goldman Sachs Group Inc 

Goldman Sachs (GS) reported a drop in quarterly profit year-over-year, leading to a 2% decrease in share price on April 18, 2023. While they beat earnings expectations, the company missed on top-line revenue. Despite this, the drop was not significant compared to previous months in bank stocks. In the earnings call, CEO David Solomon discussed the new deposit channel provided by the bank's recent partnership with Apple to offer savings accounts to holders of the Apple Card. The move into the deposit space is seen as an attempt to keep up with the trend of online high-yield savings accounts offering upward of 4%.

The bank saw a drop of 17% to $3.93 billion in fixed income trading revenue and posted a loss of $470 million on the partial sale of its $4 billion Marcus loans portfolio. Retail banking, which has a smaller role in Goldman, saw deposits down by about 3.1% quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. The bank's CEO, David Solomon, said that the events of the first quarter demonstrated the resilience of Goldman Sachs and the largest financial institutions in the country. 

&#x200B;

# NFLX: Netflix Inc 

Netflix Inc. (NFLX) reported its Q1 2023 earnings with mixed results, posting 1.75 million new subscribers, well below the expected 2.3 million. The company also announced an updated timeline for its password sharing crackdown, with the United States expected to receive the update in Q2. Despite the missed subscriber numbers and the stock decline, Netflix still added at least 1 million new subscribers in the Asia-Pacific region for the past five quarters. The company also said farewell to its mail-order DVD business that has been operating for 25 years.

The market reaction to the earnings release was negative, and the company's shares fell nearly 3% on Wednesday. The weaker-than-expected subscriber growth and the delay in the password-sharing crackdown contributed to the decline in stock price. Investors are skeptical about the possible benefits of password sharing crackdown and are waiting to see how the restriction will play out. They also want to see more traction and more established markets, where monetisation initiatives like advertising can drive growth. Analysts believe that it's still very early innings in building out the ad tech stack and that the paid-sharing product cycle is more skewed towards Q3 or Q4.

&#x200B;

# TSLA: Tesla Inc 

Tesla (TSLA) reported weaker-than-expected Q1 earnings, which weighed on other electric vehicle (EV) stocks, including GM and Rivian. The company had previously cut prices at the beginning of the year, which led to a shrinking profitability in Q1. However, Tesla CEO, Elon Musk, said the company will likely launch full self-drive technology this year and generate significant profits, which could offset some of the margin pressure it’s facing due to aggressive price cuts. Despite the weaker Q1 earnings, Tesla’s EVs are still completely sold out at the moment, which has helped alleviate some of the pricing pressures felt by Ford since rival Tesla started cutting prices this year. 

&#x200B;

# T: AT&T Inc 

AT&T Inc reported a slowdown in growth in postpaid phone subscribers for Q1 2023, but the number still beat estimates. Free cash flow fell short of expectations but was reaffirmed by the company's CFO. The business is still growing, and the overall industry is also seeing growth. AT&T's wireless service revenue growth for the quarter is over 5%, and the business grew profits by 8%.

The market reacted negatively to the news, and AT&T shares fell after the earnings release. Although the growth in subscribers still beat estimates, the slowdown is a cause for concern. Free cash flow also fell short of expectations, but the company's CFO reaffirmed the outlook for free cash flow, stating that it would progressively get better as the year went on. The health of the consumer is relatively stable, and the delinquency patterns remain consistent with those seen in the second half of 2022. The business is relatively resilient, but the lower-income cohorts are more challenged.

&#x200B;

# PM: Philip Morris International Inc 

Philip Morris International Inc reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.38, exceeding analysts' consensus of $1.34 per share for the first quarter of 2023. However, the company's revenues fell short of expectations. While Philip Morris is facing ongoing headwinds, its long-term smoke-free goals remain on track. Favorable pricing variance has been an upside for the company, although earnings declined year over year..

The markets reacted negatively to the news, with Philip Morris International falling in Thursday trading. The decline followed the announcement that the company's revenue missed expectations. 

&#x200B;

# TSM: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd 

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC), the world’s largest contract chipmaker and a major Apple supplier, announced a revenue slowdown in Q2 due to the weak global economy and high energy prices weighing on demand. The company’s CFO, Wendell Huang, stated that TSMC is expecting further inventory adjustments to continue impacting its business in Q2 2023, and the company forecasts a Q2 revenue of between $15.2 billion and $16 billion, down from $18.16 billion a year earlier. The chipmaker’s Q1 earnings rose and beat expectations, but it was the smallest quarterly earnings growth in almost four years. Despite the revenue forecast, TSMC reaffirmed its target for capital spending this year, and its shares rose about 4% after earlier being down.

TSMC’s Q2 revenue forecast highlights the inventory glut consumers are facing, while a weakening global economy clouds the demand outlook. However, the fact that TSMC reaffirmed its target for capital spending this year despite the revenue forecast provides some optimism. TSMC is an important supplier to Apple and a bellwether for the rest of the chip industry. Despite the worse-than-expected Q2 revenue forecast, the company’s shares rose around 4%, indicating that investors have already factored in the expected slowdown.",21,12,1682021345.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12tdkcd/earningsgpt_this_week_earnings_releases_and/,___KRIBZ___,"EarningsGPT: This Week Earnings Releases and Reactions Summary by ChatGPT This is the results of a script that complies news articles discussing stocks with earnings this week.

However, Tesla CEO, Elon Musk, said the company will likely launch full self-drive technology this year and generate significant profits, which could offset some of the margin pressure it’s facing due to aggressive price cuts. Despite the weaker Q1 earnings, Tesla’s EVs are still completely sold out at the moment, which has helped alleviate some of the pricing pressures felt by Ford since rival Tesla started cutting prices this year.

# T: AT&T Inc 

AT&T Inc reported a slowdown in growth in postpaid phone subscribers for Q1 2023, but the number still beat estimates. Free cash flow fell short of expectations but was reaffirmed by the company's CFO. The business is still growing, and the overall industry is also seeing growth. AT&T's wireless service revenue growth for the quarter is over 5%, and the business grew profits by 8%.

The market reacted negatively to the news, and AT&T shares fell after the earnings release. Although the growth in subscribers still beat estimates, the slowdown is a cause for concern. Free cash flow also fell short of expectations, but the company's CFO reaffirmed the outlook for free cash flow, stating that it would progressively get better as the year went on. The health of the consumer is relatively stable, and the delinquency patterns remain consistent with those seen in the second half of 2022. The business is relatively resilient, but the lower-income cohorts are more challenged.

# PM: Philip Morris International Inc 

Philip Morris International Inc reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.38, exceeding analysts' consensus of $1.34 per share for the first quarter of 2023. However, the company's revenues fell short of expectations. While Philip Morris is facing ongoing headwinds, its long-term smoke-free goals remain on track. Favorable pricing variance has been an upside for the company, although earnings declined year over year..

The markets reacted negatively to the news, with Philip Morris International falling in Thursday trading. The decline followed the announcement that the company's revenue missed expectations.

# TSM: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd 

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC), the world’s largest contract chipmaker and a major Apple supplier, announced a revenue slowdown in Q2 due to the weak global economy and high energy prices weighing on demand. The company’s CFO, Wendell Huang, stated that TSMC is expecting further inventory adjustments to continue impacting its business in Q2 2023, and the company forecasts a Q2 revenue of between $15.2 billion and $16 billion, down from $18.16 billion a year earlier. The chipmaker’s Q1 earnings rose and beat expectations, but it was the smallest quarterly earnings growth in almost four years. Despite the revenue forecast, TSMC reaffirmed its target for capital spending this year, and its shares rose about 4% after earlier being down.

TSMC’s Q2 revenue forecast highlights the inventory glut consumers are facing, while a weakening global economy clouds the demand outlook. However, the fact that TSMC reaffirmed its target for capital spending this year despite the revenue forecast provides some optimism. TSMC is an important supplier to Apple and a bellwether for the rest of the chip industry. Despite the worse-than-expected Q2 revenue forecast, the company’s shares rose around 4%, indicating that investors have already factored in the expected slowdown.",0.9963,Positive

TMO,wallstreetbets,Verizon," Verizon Wireless seems to be having a lot of trouble in the last year or two, and it's getting worse.

My own personal experience has been bad. It seems like others might be encountering the same, that some of these problems are systemic. This is one of those occasions where I'm asking myself if my own personal experience is representative of something bigger, and applicable to an investment strategy. I think they are going to lose customers, a lot of customers. I note the following:

1. It looks like VZW has botched the 5G rollout over the last couple of years. I thought the problem was my ageing Pixel 5. Places where I had more bars now have fewer bars. Friends and neighbors tell me the same. When I'm hiking with my hiking group, the friends with TMO now have more and better signals than my friends with VZW. It used to be the other way around.
2. They seemed to be unprepared for the iPhone 14 e-SIM only option -- e.g. I previously had a Pixel 5. One or more of their support staff asked me why I didn't take the SIM card out of my old phone and plug it into the new. The iPhone 14 does not have a SIM slot. It is e-SIM, exclusively. It took days across multiple phone calls to move my number. Ultimately, the people I had to speak to were the same people who port numbers from other carriers.
3. Verizon has policies that transactions initiated on-line must be completed on-line. If, for example, you buy a new phone on-line with a trade-in, and there is some complication that needs to be escalated then they will not help you in the store. In my own personal experience, I traded-in my phone. They acknowledge they received the phone. There is another department that thinks it's still in use. I don't mind the confusion. I don't mind dealing with Verizon over the phone. The problem is that they aren't able to solve the problem. You'd think that if push comes to shove, you'd be able to take your issue to a company store, as a last resort. I used to be able to do that. Not any more.
4. Verizon Assistant: Verizon has this new interactive voice response. If you are using the MyVerizon App or web portal or chat then it will attempt to steer you to Verizon Assistant. It is aggressive and ignores the possibility that maybe you are trying to avoid the Verizon Assistant. If you make the mistake of accepting their attempt to cut you over to Verizon Assistant then beware, it will drop your current channel. Aside from the fact that it keeps repeated the canned answers that do not apply to your question, it has it's own agenda. For example, the Verizon Assistant will ask you things like ""Would you like to set up voice authentication? Press 1 or say yes."" What if the answer is ""no""? It is probably the worst interactive voice response I have ever encountered.
5. Store hours: Verizon stores in my city of 2 million have reduced their hours. They now close at 6 PM (edited: was 8 PM). AT&T and TMO remain open until 8 PM, as always.",33,56,1682265465.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12wg4xs/verizon/,Garp17,"Verizon  Verizon Wireless seems to be having a lot of trouble in the last year or two, and it's getting worse.

TMO,wallstreetbets,(2/9) Tuesday's Pre-Market Stock Movers & News,"#Good morning traders and investors of the r/wallstreetbets sub! Welcome to Tuesday! Here are your pre-market stock movers & news on this Tuesday morning-

*****

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Tuesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/09/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-february-9-2021.html)

*****

> # 1. Dow set to dip after six-session win streak

> * U.S. stock futures fell Tuesday, taking a pause after the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 rose for their sixth straight sessions and the Nasdaq did so for its third session in a row. All three benchmarks logged record-high closes. February’s blistering gains ahead of Tuesday’s trading on Wall Street sent the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq up nearly 4.7%, 5.4% and 7%, respectively.

*****

> # 2. Trump’s second impeachment trial to begin in Senate

> * Former President Donald Trump faces the start of his second impeachment trial, an uphill battle for Democrats determined to prove him guilty for inciting last month’s deadly riot at the U.S. Capitol. Despite the unprecedented circumstances, experts see acquittal as the likely outcome. Out of office for nearly three weeks, the one-term Republican president, ensconced at his Florida home, still commands the support of swaths of the party and the loyalty of many GOP lawmakers, who largely doubt the legality of the trial itself. The trial is scheduled to start at 1 p.m. ET.

*****

> # 3. CBO says federal minimum wage of $15 would cost jobs

> * Raising the federal minimum wage from $7.25 per hour in annual increments to $15 per hour, as President Joe Biden has proposed, would cost 1.4 million jobs over the next four years while lifting 900,000 people out of poverty, according to a report released Monday by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The hike would add to the budget deficit, which could help Democrats pull the issue into the budget reconciliation process. Doing so could enable the Democrats to pass Biden’s $1.9 trillion Covid stimulus approach with no Republican votes. As part of the pandemic relief effort, House Democrats on Monday proposed a faster income phase-out for the next round of direct payments checks.

*****

> # 4. WHO says animals to humans ‘most likely’ path of coronavirus

> * An international team of scientists led by the World Health Organization said Tuesday the search for how the coronavirus was introduced remains a “work in progress,” but the “most likely” pathway was indeed from animals to humans. Scientists have been working for the past four weeks in the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the coronavirus was first identified in late 2019. The team dismissed a leak from a lab, saying that such theories should be regarded as “extremely unlikely.”

*****

> # 5. Reddit’s valuation doubles to $6 billion after new funding

> * Reddit — ground zero for the recent online-driven individual investor trading mania — raised more than $250 million in a new round of funding, doubling its valuation to $6 billion. Activity in Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum sparked a frenzy of buying in heavily shorted stocks, sending names like GameStop skyrocketing last month. Shares of the video game retailer — which lost 70% last week after soaring 400% the previous week — dropped another 5.9% on Monday and were under pressure in Tuesday’s premarket.

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Tuesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/09/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-february-9-2021.html)

*****

> # 1. Dow set to dip after six-session win streak

> * U.S. stock futures fell Tuesday, taking a pause after the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 rose for their sixth straight sessions and the Nasdaq did so for its third session in a row. All three benchmarks logged record-high closes. February’s blistering gains ahead of Tuesday’s trading on Wall Street sent the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq up nearly 4.7%, 5.4% and 7%, respectively.

*****

> # 2. Trump’s second impeachment trial to begin in Senate

> * Former President Donald Trump faces the start of his second impeachment trial, an uphill battle for Democrats determined to prove him guilty for inciting last month’s deadly riot at the U.S. Capitol. Despite the unprecedented circumstances, experts see acquittal as the likely outcome. Out of office for nearly three weeks, the one-term Republican president, ensconced at his Florida home, still commands the support of swaths of the party and the loyalty of many GOP lawmakers, who largely doubt the legality of the trial itself. The trial is scheduled to start at 1 p.m. ET.

*****

> # 3. CBO says federal minimum wage of $15 would cost jobs

> * Raising the federal minimum wage from $7.25 per hour in annual increments to $15 per hour, as President Joe Biden has proposed, would cost 1.4 million jobs over the next four years while lifting 900,000 people out of poverty, according to a report released Monday by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The hike would add to the budget deficit, which could help Democrats pull the issue into the budget reconciliation process. Doing so could enable the Democrats to pass Biden’s $1.9 trillion Covid stimulus approach with no Republican votes. As part of the pandemic relief effort, House Democrats on Monday proposed a faster income phase-out for the next round of direct payments checks.

*****

> # 4. WHO says animals to humans ‘most likely’ path of coronavirus

> * An international team of scientists led by the World Health Organization said Tuesday the search for how the coronavirus was introduced remains a “work in progress,” but the “most likely” pathway was indeed from animals to humans. Scientists have been working for the past four weeks in the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the coronavirus was first identified in late 2019. The team dismissed a leak from a lab, saying that such theories should be regarded as “extremely unlikely.”

*****

> # 5. Reddit’s valuation doubles to $6 billion after new funding

> * Reddit — ground zero for the recent online-driven individual investor trading mania — raised more than $250 million in a new round of funding, doubling its valuation to $6 billion. Activity in Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum sparked a frenzy of buying in heavily shorted stocks, sending names like GameStop skyrocketing last month. Shares of the video game retailer — which lost 70% last week after soaring 400% the previous week — dropped another 5.9% on Monday and were under pressure in Tuesday’s premarket.

#**DISCUSS!**

What's on everyone's radar for today's trading day ahead here at r/wallstreetbets?

*****

# **I hope you all have an excellent trading day ahead today on this Tuesday, February 9th, 2021! :)**",0.9994,Positive
TMO,wallstreetbets,DDDD - Is GME being Illegally Naked Short Sold?,"This will be a quick DDDD (Data-Driven DD) because it's late and pretty much every WSB post today has been about it. To catch up, [read this post that inspired by investigation](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lak773/why_were_still_winning_and_why_were_still_going/) and this post that I this does a very good job explaining [the theory](https://www.reddit.com/user/bcRIPster/comments/labq6u/follow_the_crumbs_gme_exposed_the_meta/). Basically, a lot of people here believe that institutions have been naked short selling GME, effectively creating fake or ""counterfeit"" GME stock, and it's there's some systematic fraud going on.

Much of the discussion has been centered around the [Failure to Deliver data released](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm) by the SEC for the first half of Jan. A Failure to Deliver is reported when a broker is unable to deliver a share that they have sold to the clearing house by the settlement date (2 days after the transaction); [see my DDDD discussing what how this all works if you're curious](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9sh9e/dddd_why_gme_might_next_week_and_how_it_could/). This can happen for many reason, and in the [examples given by the SEC](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm) includes delays if people are physically delivering share certificates for some reason, and market makers (eg. Citadel) legally selling shares to a buyer without an actual seller (i.e. naked short sale) to provide liquidity; they just need to make sure they're able to later source that share quickly after it. Looks like the theory floating around r/wallstreetbets today is that non-market makers are illegally naked short selling GME, which is the topic of investigation for today.

One thing I've noticed that's been missing from many of these discussions is a proper analysis of the SEC-provided data on the Failure to Deliver numbers, so I decided to add this to help y'all make some informed decisions.

*Disclaimer - This is not financial advice, and a lot of the content below is my personal opinion and for ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY. In fact, the numbers, facts, or explanations presented below could be wrong and be made up and with some satire thrown in. Don't buy random options because some person on the internet says so. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money, and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance.*

**Methodology**

I'm going to analyze this data using a script to look at a rough transactional value and approximate percentage of volume that the failure-to-deliver shares represent. Now, **these are all rough and kind of inaccurate especially for low-volume tickers** because the SEC data is based on the total number of outstanding failure-to-deliver shares for a particular settlement date. This means that

1. Since you can have the same share being failed to deliver multiple days in a row, shares in these situations will be counted multiple times in all the data shown below.
2. The earliest possible date shares in a trade can be counted as failed to be delivered is 3 trading days after the transaction occurred, so **literally none of the failure-to-deliver shares represents that day's volume**. However, I'm going to make an assumption that a day's volume will be in the same ball park as the volume from 3 days ago, so it should give a rough estimate. There are quite a few cases, especially with small-caps, where this is clearly not the case, and you will see many cases with a 100+% failure to deliver / volume results for this reason.
3. The dollar value itself is wrong because it's using the price at settlement date, not the transaction date

However, with these caveats, the purpose is to compare GME with other stocks to see if anything stands out using these metrics, using things like dollar value and volume rather than the raw number of shares to normalize the data.

**The Code**

    from collections import defaultdict
    import time
    import requests
    POLYGON_API_KEY = '<ADD YOUR API KEY HERE>'
    VOLUME_DATA_API_URL = 'https://api.polygon.io/v1/open-close/{}/2021-01-{}?unadjusted=true&apiKey=' + POLYGON_API_KEY
    
    data
    dates_to_stocks = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(float))
    f = open('fail_to_delivers.txt', 'r') # https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm
    for line in f:
        parts = line.split('|');
        date = parts[0]
        ticker = parts[2]
        try:
            fails = int(parts[3])
            price = float(parts[5])
            value_of_fails = price * fails
            dates_to_stocks[date][ticker] = (value_of_fails, fails)
        except ValueError:
            # fails or price was not a number; probably not traded (eg.'.')
            pass
    
    for date, stocks in dates_to_stocks.items():
        day = int(date[-2:])
        print('Data for Jan {}'.format(day))
        sorted_stocks = sorted(stocks.items(), key = lambda stock: stock[1][0])
        sorted_stocks = filter(lambda stock: stock[1][0] > 10000000, sorted_stocks)
        for ticker, data in sorted_stocks:
            val_of_fails = data[0]
            num_fails = data[1]
            req = requests.get(url=VOLUME_DATA_API_URL.format(ticker, str(day).zfill(2)))
            res = req.json()
            if res['status'] == 'NOT_FOUND':
                print('No volume data for {}'.format(ticker))
                continue
            else:
                try:
                    volume = res['volume']
                except KeyError:
                    print(res)
            val_of_fails_in_mill = int(val_of_fails / 1000000)
            pct_vol = num_fails / volume * 100
            print('{: <6} ${: <5} {: <9} / {: < 12} {:.2f}% of vol'.format(ticker, str(val_of_fails_in_mill) + 'M', num_fails, volume, pct_vol))

Here's some code I hacked together myself. If anyone sees a bug please let me know and I'll re-calculate all this data, but otherwise you can try this yourself at home to crunch the data yourself after getting a Polygon API key, although you might need additional code to slow down the API requests since the free plan has a rate limit.

If everything above sounded gibberish to you, this code basically does all the calculations I mentioned above by reading the SEC data where the dollar value > 10M and pulling volume for the day from a third party source.

I'll let y'all discuss what this means in the comments. Have Fun.

EDIT - Someone pointed out a mistake in my script. Fixed, and added a bit more data

EDIT 2 - For those without enough brain wrinkles / attention span to interpret this - There may have been shady shit in the first few days of Jan, but doesn't look like anything went on in the second week. Will need to wait till Feb 15 to see data in the last few weeks of Jan. I'll probably do some more analysis when that time comes",269,59,1612256395.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/larhlw/dddd_is_gme_being_illegally_naked_short_sold/,ASoftEngStudent,"DDDD - Is GME being Illegally Naked Short Sold? This will be a quick DDDD (Data-Driven DD) because it's late and pretty much every WSB post today has been about it. To catch up, [read this post that inspired by investigation](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lak773/why_were_still_winning_and_why_were_still_going/) and this post that I this does a very good job explaining [the theory](https://www.reddit.com/user/bcRIPster/comments/labq6u/follow_the_crumbs_gme_exposed_the_meta/). Basically, a lot of people here believe that institutions have been naked short selling GME, effectively creating fake or ""counterfeit"" GME stock, and it's there's some systematic fraud going on.

Much of the discussion has been centered around the [Failure to Deliver data released](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm) by the SEC for the first half of Jan. A Failure to Deliver is reported when a broker is unable to deliver a share that they have sold to the clearing house by the settlement date (2 days after the transaction); [see my DDDD discussing what how this all works if you're curious](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9sh9e/dddd_why_gme_might_next_week_and_how_it_could/). This can happen for many reason, and in the [examples given by the SEC](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm) includes delays if people are physically delivering share certificates for some reason, and market makers (eg. Citadel) legally selling shares to a buyer without an actual seller (i.e. naked short sale) to provide liquidity; they just need to make sure they're able to later source that share quickly after it. Looks like the theory floating around r/wallstreetbets today is that non-market makers are illegally naked short selling GME, which is the topic of investigation for today.

One thing I've noticed that's been missing from many of these discussions is a proper analysis of the SEC-provided data on the Failure to Deliver numbers, so I decided to add this to help y'all make some informed decisions.

*Disclaimer - This is not financial advice, and a lot of the content below is my personal opinion and for ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY. In fact, the numbers, facts, or explanations presented below could be wrong and be made up and with some satire thrown in. Don't buy random options because some person on the internet says so. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money, and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance.*

**Methodology**

I'm going to analyze this data using a script to look at a rough transactional value and approximate percentage of volume that the failure-to-deliver shares represent. Now, **these are all rough and kind of inaccurate especially for low-volume tickers** because the SEC data is based on the total number of outstanding failure-to-deliver shares for a particular settlement date. This means that

1. Since you can have the same share being failed to deliver multiple days in a row, shares in these situations will be counted multiple times in all the data shown below.
2. The earliest possible date shares in a trade can be counted as failed to be delivered is 3 trading days after the transaction occurred, so **literally none of the failure-to-deliver shares represents that day's volume**. However, I'm going to make an assumption that a day's volume will be in the same ball park as the volume from 3 days ago, so it should give a rough estimate. There are quite a few cases, especially with small-caps, where this is clearly not the case, and you will see many cases with a 100+% failure to deliver / volume results for this reason.
3. The dollar value itself is wrong because it's using the price at settlement date, not the transaction date

However, with these caveats, the purpose is to compare GME with other stocks to see if anything stands out using these metrics, using things like dollar value and volume rather than the raw number of shares to normalize the data.

**The Code**

    from collections import defaultdict
    import time
    import requests
    POLYGON_API_KEY = '<ADD YOUR API KEY HERE>'
    VOLUME_DATA_API_URL = 'https://api.polygon.io/v1/open-close/{}/2021-01-{}?unadjusted=true&apiKey=' + POLYGON_API_KEY
    
    data
    dates_to_stocks = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(float))
    f = open('fail_to_delivers.txt', 'r') # https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm
    for line in f:
        parts = line.split('|');
        date = parts[0]
        ticker = parts[2]
        try:
            fails = int(parts[3])
            price = float(parts[5])
            value_of_fails = price * fails
            dates_to_stocks[date][ticker] = (value_of_fails, fails)
        except ValueError:
            # fails or price was not a number; probably not traded (eg.'.')
            pass
    
    for date, stocks in dates_to_stocks.items():
        day = int(date[-2:])
        print('Data for Jan {}'.format(day))
        sorted_stocks = sorted(stocks.items(), key = lambda stock: stock[1][0])
        sorted_stocks = filter(lambda stock: stock[1][0] > 10000000, sorted_stocks)
        for ticker, data in sorted_stocks:
            val_of_fails = data[0]
            num_fails = data[1]
            req = requests.get(url=VOLUME_DATA_API_URL.format(ticker, str(day).zfill(2)))
            res = req.json()
            if res['status'] == 'NOT_FOUND':
                print('No volume data for {}'.format(ticker))
                continue
            else:
                try:
                    volume = res['volume']
                except KeyError:
                    print(res)
            val_of_fails_in_mill = int(val_of_fails / 1000000)
            pct_vol = num_fails / volume * 100
            print('{: <6} ${: <5} {: <9} / {: < 12} {:.2f}% of vol'.format(ticker, str(val_of_fails_in_mill) + 'M', num_fails, volume, pct_vol))

Here's some code I hacked together myself. If anyone sees a bug please let me know and I'll re-calculate all this data, but otherwise you can try this yourself at home to crunch the data yourself after getting a Polygon API key, although you might need additional code to slow down the API requests since the free plan has a rate limit.

If everything above sounded gibberish to you, this code basically does all the calculations I mentioned above by reading the SEC data where the dollar value > 10M and pulling volume for the day from a third party source.

I'll let y'all discuss what this means in the comments. Have Fun.

EDIT - Someone pointed out a mistake in my script. Fixed, and added a bit more data

EDIT 2 - For those without enough brain wrinkles / attention span to interpret this - There may have been shady shit in the first few days of Jan, but doesn't look like anything went on in the second week. Will need to wait till Feb 15 to see data in the last few weeks of Jan. I'll probably do some more analysis when that time comes",-0.9676,Negative
TMO,wallstreetbets,"Reeeeeeeeecap of today's market driving news (Jan 29, 2021 after market close)","* After a hiatus due to GME craze, reeeeecaps are back for a limited time. The broader market took a nose dive today as volatility resume in earnest due to, of all things, fucking meme stocks. As GME, AMC, KOSS, and others continue their large swings to the stratosphere much to the grief of short sides, chatters are now about that sell-offs are partly a liquidity issue as funds close out their long position to cover (and prevent a margin call) on their decimated short positions in GME et al. VIX continues the spike from Wednesday and was up as high as 19% as systemic risk to the market are now fully in the spotlight.

* During intraday low, the DOW was down as much as -747 pts while SPX was down -94 pts and Chadsdaq was down -352 pts. Almost all sectors are being punished while a few medical products company in SPX escape into the greens due to a strong ER and an overall strengthened demand - cuz there's a fucking global pandemic. TMO is up 2.93% for the day to $511 while DHR is up 4% to $237. Conversely, big tech are big fucked as AAPL, FB, and MSFT are all down significantly. AAPL closed down -3.74%, FB down -2.52%, and MSFT closed down -2.92% (despite a strong ER result earlier in the week). AMZN, GOOGL, and NFLX are all down around -1%.

* GME swings to a strong green opening after RH relents being a shill bag for Citadel, allowing limited GME and AMC trading (to one or five fucking shares? what a joke). Turns out when the product is free, you're the product? In yet another volatile session, intraday high was at the opening $413 and intraday low was at $250 (a 40% intraday move) as MMs clear out their delta and escapes a total gamma squeeze to live yet another day. The short squeeze, however, is still in play as GME closes up 68% to close at $325, thanks to a reversal of movement shortly before power hour. As of writing, short sellers are at mark-to-market loss of almost 20 bil. You gotta feel for them as they might need to downgrade from a super yacht to a pleb boat. Such shame.

* Congress critters, media pundits, and everyone's moms continue to give their 2cents on the GME and gang episode - and while consensus is usually in favor of the little guys, being a cynical F - you should expect regulations and further restrictions from regulators/industry moving forward. One likely curb to help save MMs would be restricting options trading to a certain account size, or further restricting access to 0dte, particularly for volatile underlyings. Expect all this to come out with messaging of ""helping to protect our customers.""

* RoaringKitty AKA DFV gets [nice profile from the NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/29/technology/roaring-kitty-reddit-gamestop-markets.html) and if you are one of the few millions who are new to the story + sub, the piece does a good job giving a history of how DFV got started. Yours truly somehow got quoted in the piece as well and while the quote was decisively retarded as F, no cap it was an accurate description of most of our mindset. (Of all the fucking quotes to pick out from DFV's updates since 2019...). DFV posted his [latest YOLO update](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l846a1/gme_yolo_monthend_update_jan_2021/) minutes after market close. Don't click thru. Guess if he's still in?

* If you're unhappy with your broker due to restrictions, select veteran brokerages such as Fidelity, Vanguard, ETrade, has placed zero restriction (short of whatever that is already existed) on meme stock trading. As it turns out companies with decent corporate value are actually NOT dick bags, even in the face of market volatility. (Sure their UI might be stuck in the 90s and early 2000s). Things are especially helpful as these brokerages do their own clearing and aren't beholden to Citadel and others. While brokers who use Apex as a clearing house has had limited time restriction (Ally, TDA, Tasty etc.) they are definitely far better than whatever RH has done to their customer.

* Notable upgrades and downgrades: Despite receiving a strong upgrades this AM, BA couldn't handle overall macro pressure and its green opening of +2% swung to red as the day chugs on. Morgan Stanley double upgraded Boeing to overweight form underweight with a PT of $230, up from $165. BA closed the day down -1.54% to $194, further contributing to DOW's demise. SFIX, who rode quite a bit of the short squeeze mania in recent days (from $55 to $100 within two weeks) was hit with a downgrade by Baird as they notch the shares down to neutral from outperform with a PT of $85. SFIX closed the day down -4.44% to $95. GM, who's looking more and more likely to be the next strong EV contender receives another PT hike to $80 from $57 by Morgan Stanley. Shares remain unchanged given the recent run-up and closed the day flat at -0.7% to $50.68.

* After a decent rally from ER, AAL immediately sets out to offer another round of 1 bil in stocks, further fucking over their long term boomer shareholders. Already selling 1 bil in stock back in Oct of last year, the new offering will be selling up to 1.12 bil in more. Shares of American Airline close the day down -5% to $17. Others in the sector are also down, particular as UAL warns that thousands of job are at risk again - despite a 15 bil handout from the recent stimulus package. UAL close down -6% to $40, DAL down -5.29% to $38. Meanwhile JBLU and LUV handles the sector news a bit better given their management isn't complete trash.

* In WSB meme stock land, everything is a fucking meme stock now. AMC close the day up 53% back above $13. BB, a stock without the short squeeze factor closed the day down -3.75% to $14. If you like the previous DDs and plays on BB - you can always regrab $15c or $20c leaps when IV has cool down some more after VIX has retreated. As of writing Jan 22 and Jan 23 leaps are still looking at 140-150% IV. Which is a bit too expensive in premium. ICLN retreats yet again, down -3.3%. MT is down -3.8% after running up almost 7% the day before, and PLTR close the day down -1.35% to $35 ish. TSLA took another haircut of -5% to close out at $793, furthering yesterday's decline after an ER profit miss that didn't impress the market. Yeah, you almost forgot about all these tickers, didn't ya?

* Looking for a bullish meme stock play but just can't stomach the IV or premiums level and shares are too boomer (or out of reach in the case of GME lol)? Thanks to crazy high IV, you can join theta gang sell GME puts (cash covered or spread) at strikes of $25p to $35p for April, netting you premium of around $7 to $11. This bakes in one Q4 ER which GME should do well in, and with IV at +400% and delta of under 0.02 and lower (heh), the odds are stacked in your favor to come out ahead of the play. If assigned, you'll be paying only $18 for GME for the 25p and $24 for the 35p. Another company that will likely be a decent hold if assigned: BB puts are also going for decent premium. Feb 19 10p is going for around $1.75 with a delta of 0.2, or you can go further out to March 10p which nets you about $2.5 with a delta of 0.2 as well.

* **Noteworthy ERs:** With most of the big bois ER behind us (and overshadowed by meme stocks), earnings season continues next week with a few more market movers. On Feb 2nd, BABA, PFE, and UPS all reports before market opens. Later that afternoon, AMZN will report after market close. Further along the week, PYPL reports on Feb 3 after market close while PINS reports Feb 4 after market close. (PINS doesn't really move market but its noteworthy enough).

* **Notable econ numbers** includes the usual boys with Monday PMI at 9:45 AM ET, ISM manufacturing index at 10 AM ET, jobless claims on Thursday at 8:30 AM and the big daddy employment situation (nonfarm payroll etc) on Friday at 8:30 AM ET. 

* The DOW closed down -2% or -622 pts, Nasdaq down -2% or -266 pts, SPX down -1.93% or -73 pts, and RUT close down -1.57% or -32 pts.

(Yesterday's recap: none, but you can read [last's week](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2a0e9/reeeeeeeeecap_of_todays_marketdriving_news_jan_21/) and bask in the past before GME and the Internet toppled the hedgies)",546,95,1611954598.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l84b0g/reeeeeeeeecap_of_todays_market_driving_news_jan/,freehouse_throwaway,"Reeeeeeeeecap of today's market driving news (Jan 29, 2021 after market close) * After a hiatus due to GME craze, reeeeecaps are back for a limited time.

* If you're unhappy with your broker due to restrictions, select veteran brokerages such as Fidelity, Vanguard, ETrade, has placed zero restriction (short of whatever that is already existed) on meme stock trading. As it turns out companies with decent corporate value are actually NOT dick bags, even in the face of market volatility. (Sure their UI might be stuck in the 90s and early 2000s). Things are especially helpful as these brokerages do their own clearing and aren't beholden to Citadel and others. While brokers who use Apex as a clearing house has had limited time restriction (Ally, TDA, Tasty etc.) they are definitely far better than whatever RH has done to their customer.

* Notable upgrades and downgrades: Despite receiving a strong upgrades this AM, BA couldn't handle overall macro pressure and its green opening of +2% swung to red as the day chugs on. Morgan Stanley double upgraded Boeing to overweight form underweight with a PT of $230, up from $165. BA closed the day down -1.54% to $194, further contributing to DOW's demise. SFIX, who rode quite a bit of the short squeeze mania in recent days (from $55 to $100 within two weeks) was hit with a downgrade by Baird as they notch the shares down to neutral from outperform with a PT of $85. SFIX closed the day down -4.44% to $95. GM, who's looking more and more likely to be the next strong EV contender receives another PT hike to $80 from $57 by Morgan Stanley. Shares remain unchanged given the recent run-up and closed the day flat at -0.7% to $50.68.

* After a decent rally from ER, AAL immediately sets out to offer another round of 1 bil in stocks, further fucking over their long term boomer shareholders. Already selling 1 bil in stock back in Oct of last year, the new offering will be selling up to 1.12 bil in more. Shares of American Airline close the day down -5% to $17. Others in the sector are also down, particular as UAL warns that thousands of job are at risk again - despite a 15 bil handout from the recent stimulus package. UAL close down -6% to $40, DAL down -5.29% to $38. Meanwhile JBLU and LUV handles the sector news a bit better given their management isn't complete trash.

* In WSB meme stock land, everything is a fucking meme stock now. AMC close the day up 53% back above $13. BB, a stock without the short squeeze factor closed the day down -3.75% to $14. If you like the previous DDs and plays on BB - you can always regrab $15c or $20c leaps when IV has cool down some more after VIX has retreated. As of writing Jan 22 and Jan 23 leaps are still looking at 140-150% IV. Which is a bit too expensive in premium. ICLN retreats yet again, down -3.3%. MT is down -3.8% after running up almost 7% the day before, and PLTR close the day down -1.35% to $35 ish. TSLA took another haircut of -5% to close out at $793, furthering yesterday's decline after an ER profit miss that didn't impress the market. Yeah, you almost forgot about all these tickers, didn't ya?

* Looking for a bullish meme stock play but just can't stomach the IV or premiums level and shares are too boomer (or out of reach in the case of GME lol)? Thanks to crazy high IV, you can join theta gang sell GME puts (cash covered or spread) at strikes of $25p to $35p for April, netting you premium of around $7 to $11. This bakes in one Q4 ER which GME should do well in, and with IV at +400% and delta of under 0.02 and lower (heh), the odds are stacked in your favor to come out ahead of the play. If assigned, you'll be paying only $18 for GME for the 25p and $24 for the 35p. Another company that will likely be a decent hold if assigned: BB puts are also going for decent premium. Feb 19 10p is going for around $1.75 with a delta of 0.2, or you can go further out to March 10p which nets you about $2.5 with a delta of 0.2 as well.

* **Noteworthy ERs:** With most of the big bois ER behind us (and overshadowed by meme stocks), earnings season continues next week with a few more market movers. On Feb 2nd, BABA, PFE, and UPS all reports before market opens. Later that afternoon, AMZN will report after market close. Further along the week, PYPL reports on Feb 3 after market close while PINS reports Feb 4 after market close. (PINS doesn't really move market but its noteworthy enough).

* **Notable econ numbers** includes the usual boys with Monday PMI at 9:45 AM ET, ISM manufacturing index at 10 AM ET, jobless claims on Thursday at 8:30 AM and the big daddy employment situation (nonfarm payroll etc) on Friday at 8:30 AM ET. 

* The DOW closed down -2% or -622 pts, Nasdaq down -2% or -266 pts, SPX down -1.93% or -73 pts, and RUT close down -1.57% or -32 pts.

(Yesterday's recap: none, but you can read [last's week](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2a0e9/reeeeeeeeecap_of_todays_marketdriving_news_jan_21/) and bask in the past before GME and the Internet toppled the hedgies)",0.9888,Positive
TMO,wallstreetbets,TMO Earnings End of January,"Buy TMO calls for March between 450-500 strike price.

The stock is down big and people are saying it’s because of the vaccine news since this means less testing (retards say this). The real reason is it went on a massive run before and after last earnings. Why? Because RT-qPCR tests and other testing equipment/reagents they sell account for $8 billion or 25% of their quarterly revenue.

Let me be clear here: TESTING HAS NOT SLOWED DOWN AND WILL NOT SLOW DOWN BECAUSE OF A VACCINE. The amount of testing from Q3 will be significantly smaller than the testing we will see in Q4. Why? Because RT-qPCR is the gold standard of testing and TMO has one of, if not THE, best kits out there. Plus everyone in science knows TMO and will have no problem relying on their kits.

You can also look at my older post from Q3 for more details.

They will make more revenue from selling freezers, too, but please stfu about this being why TMO is a buy right now. That’s idiotic. It’s their diagnostics, plastics, reagents, and manufacturing that will boost revenue.

TLDR: Buy TMO March calls between 400-500 strike.

TMO,wallstreetbets,Thermo Fisher Scientific will make HUGE gains in the near future,"Ok listen up retards, TMO shares dropped this month from a high of $550 on 11/9 down to $439 earlier this week for no reason. It recently bottomed out, just started recovering, and now were left with an easy way to 5x our money simply by pressing the ""buy"" button on calls. Way easier than making $10/hr at wendys even with the frequent $50 bonuses from sucking cock back behind the dumpster. Currently it closed at $448.45, meanwhile every single analyst has been giving it a price target above $500 since mid october with the most recent rating being $550. Their profits are fucking soaring and they're literally the biggest company in their industry which is selling expensive, fancy, scientific lab equipment to rich nerds.

The closest/biggest competitor I could find (Agilent Technologies) has 1/5th of TMO's gross revenue while TMO also has higher profit margins than Agilent which also has multibillion dollar revenue. Every other competitor I found has around 1/10th the revenue or less, so TMO basically cornered the market here while second place is in this industry might as well be last place because TMO already won years ago.

Before any smooth brains point out that InSiDeRs sOlD $71m last quarter, insiders have been selling every quarter for several years so they can afford their big mansions, lambos, and yachts while the entire time the company has been growing faster than my mother's terminal cancer. Most recent insider sale was like 31 days ago anyway when the CEO sold less than 0.5% of the shares he owned for $4,799,400

This shit is way oversold, skipping the road to recovery and jumping on the mission to moon town back above $500+ easily in the near future. Likely mid $500s and over $600 a few months later.

My current positions:

1/15/21 $500 calls bought over time on Wednesday that cost me no more than $4.00 each

Positions I'm adding Friday morning:

3/19/21 $500c - buying a couple of these but they cost twice as much as January calls so January calls are better. I'm only buying 2 or 3 of these so I dont miss out on any February/early March mooning action



3/19/21 $600c - planning on getting 5 of these as they will be some serious money makers if were hitting $600 sooner than I thought

1/15/21 $600 calls - Get your big dick lottery tickets right here boys. Most recent call traded for $0.30 each so buying 100 calls is affordable for most people and this has serious, but low chance of 50 bagger potential.

TMO,wallstreetbets,"Ultra cold freezers, global supply chains, Thermo Fisher Scientific, and degenerate gambling.","I just found there is a pandemic going on.

2 major players should be rolling out vaccines early next year. 

The FDA is reviewing Pfizer’s ~95% effective vaccine and should approve its emergency use mid December. The biggest challenge with this vaccine is that it must be stored in ultra cold conditions.

TMO makes the reagents for covid tests and is one of the major manufacturers of ultra-cold freezers (UCF). This stock was running up until November, and has been dropping lately, possibly bc Moderno announced their vaccine which doesn’t need special cooling and possibly bc their covid tests aren’t that profitable. 

However, I just checked, and more people are going to need the vaccine than will be able to get the vaccine. Many hospitals are trying to position themselves to be able to distribute whatever vaccine they can get their hands on, my wife’s boyfriend’s hospital is a real shithole and even they spent $16k buying a UCF.

TMO has a $178B market cap and is well positioned to fill this UCF need. BOFA recently upgraded them from hold to buy, and TMO just adjusted their projected earnings for next quarter (to be announced at the end of Jan)

In addition to the private sector, with their stability and global logistics network, they would be a prime target for government contracts to help with vaccine distribution efforts from groups like The Who (I love it when good bands go into philanthropy)

TMO,wallstreetbets,Thermo Fisher (TMO) DD,"Thermo Fisher is a leading biotech company that supplies materials and reagents for numerous applications from diagnostics to basic everyday research. TMO has positioned itself uniquely to perform well and see terrific profits from Covid-19 testing. They have supplied kits for RT-PCR (acute infections of Covid-19) globally and these kits are increasing in demand. 

I am a researcher in the biomedical sciences working to develop novel diagnostics that will likely be used in the next 5 years (let's say 10 to be conservative). Currently, RT-PCR is the best method of detecting acute infections of Covid-19 and TMO is dominating the testing field. I collaborate with a lab that is currently running 6,000 tests a day at my university and they plan to keep this up throughout the fall. We are just one university and universities across the nation, as well as workplaces and hospitals, will continue to test their staff members or students until Covid-19 is handled and we have no clue when they will come. Since universities have begun bringing students back to campus and opening up operations expect a dramatic increase in testing using RT-PCR.

What does this mean? This means the universities, hospitals, workplaces, etc. are spending thousands of dollars a day to test their personnel. Who is supplying the vast majority of these tests? TMO.

TMO has earnings coming up mid-October and I fully expect that they will completely blow away earnings and there is currently no hype for a run up. Some time mid-September I expect a steady price increase as people begin to see the advantage TMO has in the market. Currently, I have no positions in TMO but I will pick up some Calls mid-to-late September to catch the run-up to earnings.

TMO dominates the testing supplies, but there are some alternatives that you can look into as well:

* Qiagen (QGEN): Supplies RNA extraction kits used to isolate patient RNA (FDA approved, CDC recommended).
* Danaher (DHR): Supplies nucleic acids (IDT) just has blown up with current research and also owns Beckman Coulter which supplies plate readers that can read thousands of samples within a couple hours (news just broke).
* BioRad (BIO): Supplies qPCR machines, which also analyze the patient samples.

I'm focusing on TMO and QGEN and I see a serious advantage with TMO. DHR and BIO mostly supply machines with regards to Covid-19 and less money is made from that. I truly don't think the insane amount of testing kits TMO is providing is priced in yet. I expect it to rise to 450 leading up to earnings.",29,28,1598564623.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ihu9qm/thermo_fisher_tmo_dd/,Burnit0ut,"Thermo Fisher (TMO) DD Thermo Fisher is a leading biotech company that supplies materials and reagents for numerous applications from diagnostics to basic everyday research.

 Name: Luminex Corporation

 Exchange: Nasdaq  
 Founded: 1995  
 Industry: Life Sciences Tools and Services  
 Sector: Pharmaceuticals & Biotech  
 Market Cap: US$1.431b  
 Shares outstanding: 46.36m  
 Website: [https://www.luminexcorp.com](https://www.luminexcorp.com/)

What do they do?  
 “Luminex Corp develops, manufactures and sells proprietary biological testing technologies and products with applications throughout the life sciences and diagnostics industries. Its products include MAGPIX, Luminex 100/200, & FLEXMAP 3D. “

""\[Luminex offers\] a wide range of solutions applicable in diverse markets including clinical diagnostics, pharmaceutical drug discovery, biomedical research, genomic and proteomic research, biodefense research, and food safety.""

Are they doing anything for the coronavirus?  
 Yes, but they aren’t one of the “penny stock companies” who are riding the coat tails of FOMO/Hopium. Luminex has been around a very long time, and are not reliant on covid-19 related sales. With that said, they are also selling their FDA authorized (under EUA) covid-19 test (SARS-CoV-2 Assay designed for use in Luminex’s ARIES Molecular Diagnostics Platform– good video on how it works: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOy2bUePLJ8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOy2bUePLJ8&feature=youtu.be)). I will also mention though, that covid19 has been providing them with positive tailwinds thanks to molecular diagnostic revenue, which was $64.9M for the most recent quarter, up more than 100% compared to same quarter 2019.

How are they financially?  
 According to simplywall.st, they have [$455M](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/455M) in short-term assets, $62.8M in liabilities. Their debt/equity is 39.3%. Their most recent ER, from August 4th, saw them beat earnings with 0.27 EPS vs. 0.08 consensus, and beat revenue with 109.5M vs 107.4M. Additionally, they are seeing 31.9% revenue growth year-over-year. For Full Year 2020 they are expecting revenue at or above $415M.   
 [https://www.earningswhispers.com/epsdetails/lmnx](https://www.earningswhispers.com/epsdetails/lmnx)

Additionally, their most recent ER has these highlights of the quarter mentioned:

\*\*Licensed Technologies Group revenue of $35.2M, down 4% vs. Q2 2019  
\*\*Flow Cytometry revenue of $7.4M, down 44% vs. Q2 2019, continues to be significantly impacted by the slowdown in academic research due to COVID-19  
\*\*Operating cash flow of $31M and $24M for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020  
\*\*Ended the quarter with an order book of approximately $29M, most of which is COVID-19 related;            almost six times the pre-COVID quarterly average  
\*\*Sold or contracted 162 sample-to-answer systems in the quarter, the majority of which were ARIES®  
\*\*Received U.S. FDA Emergency Use Authorization on April 6, 2020 for the 	ARIES® SARS-CoV-2 Assay  
\*\* Received U.S. FDA EUA for COVID-19 antibody test on July 16, 2020

Earnings call transcript:

[https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/08/05/luminex-corp-de-lmnx-q2-2020-earnings-call-transcr.aspx](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/08/05/luminex-corp-de-lmnx-q2-2020-earnings-call-transcr.aspx)

I particularly like this portion of the CEO’s statement:

“We are very excited about the opportunity for this COVID-19 specific antibody tests in the market. We also submitted our **fourth assay** to the FDA for EUA clearances a few weeks ago, **a new NxTAG RPP plus SARS-CoV-2 consolidated panel**. Finally, we continue to work on a number of products in our VERIGENE family. We recently submitted SARS-CoV-2 stand-alone assay on VERIGENE I and planning to submit soon for an EUA for VERIGENE II Respiratory assay with the SARS-CoV-2 target.

We are in the process of **expanding** our total manufacturing capacity of all MDx assay **from approximately 1.8 million tests per quarter to approximately 3 million tests per quarter** as a result of **significant demand** for our product to assist in addressing the COVID-19 pandemic.”

Do they pay a dividend?  
 Luminex has been known to pay a quarterly dividend, most recently in Q2 2020 at 1.17% which had a June 18 ex-div and was payable July 9th.   

Who is their CEO?  
 Nachum Shamir is the current CEO/Chairman, and has been there since 2014. Prior to that he worked at IDB Holding from 2006 to 2014, and just prior to that in 2004/2005 he served as President of Kodak Versamark, Inc. (part of Eastman Kodak Company KODK). He currently receives a $743k salary, with total compensation of $3.36M which is roughly 25% lower than similar size companies. Mr. Shamir currently owns 0.41% of LMNX, and the only insider owning more (besides Mr. Loewenbaum) is the CFO/SVP Harriss Currie who has 0.54% ownership.

What does institutional ownership look like?  
 According to MarketBeat.com, Q1 saw 68M bought/26M sold by institutions. Q2 saw 56M bought, 50M sold, and thus far in Q3 114M bought with only 17M sold.   
 [https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/lmnx/institutional-ownership/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/lmnx/institutional-ownership/)

According to fintel.io:  
 “Luminex Corp. (US:LMNX) has 456 institutional owners and shareholders that have filed 13D/G or 13F forms with the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC). These institutions hold a total of 41,360,722 shares. Largest shareholders include BlackRock Inc., Vanguard Group Inc, RGM Capital, LLC, IJR - iShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF, Renaissance Technologies Llc, Dimensional Fund Advisors Lp, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, State Street Corp, Select Equity Group, L.P., and VTSMX - Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund Investor Shares.“  
 [https://fintel.io/so/us/lmnx](https://fintel.io/so/us/lmnx)

Why was there a drop recently after earnings, if they beat & are growing?  
 George Loewenbaum has been with the company for 25 years, and they announced his resignation. Additionally, there was insider selling which was detailed out in May, and Mr. Loewenbaum has also been selling off some of his shares. Interesting side note, Mr. Loewenbaum also serves on the board of 3D Systems Corporation which trades under DDD and does 3d printing.  

I do not believe the market cares about sentiment; in that the market makers/institutions/hedge funds are not sentimental.  Thus, I speculate the drop from $40 to $30 was largely due to the desire to get more shares at a cheaper price. If you really look at the institutional ownership, it’s currently 77.37% and growing every quarter this year.

Analyzing LMNX Stock Price

https://preview.redd.it/k89h61sbk7h51.jpg?width=2389&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=afe6e45d00c716527e61e4f79228fe1646b27406

Luminex would be $51 stock if it traded at the same p/s as [$TMO](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/TMO), or $47 if it traded at same p/b as [$ATRC](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/ATRC).

The stock is currently trading in an upward channel, with the current price very near the bottom channel support line. If the stock falls below $29.80, it may be headed for a further decline. While I do not know the future, many stocks have been sold off immediately after ER despite beating, only to immediately recover. A good example of this is Owens & Minor, Inc. (OMI ticker). They fell from $17 to $13, then rebounded back up to high $16s in the matter of 10 trading days (from fall to recovery).  

On Friday, it double bottomed around $30.50 and closed at $30.87, down 3.35% for the day. LMNX is a highly volatile stock, with 3 of the last 4 days seeing a +/- 3% movement. This appears to be quite normal for LMNX, and when it moves up, it does so sharply over a period of days or even weeks.   

Chart wise, D crossed above K on SlowStoch and RSI (14) is currently nearing oversold at 40.58. The MACD & Signal deviation are at 3x, which is the relatively high and unusual (-.648 macd/0.213 signal). LMNX also recently bounced off the lower Bollinger band, and closed just below the MA5 $31.22.

Huge growth and major institutional buying, with relatively little selling, makes this worth a closer look.

One final note I will make, are option calls open interest for next Friday, August 21st.  

For calls, there are:

44 OI for $30 strike; 408 OI for $35 strike; 1130 OI for $40 strike (increased by 9 Friday); 135 OI for $45 strike

For puts, there are: 338 OI for $30 strike (increased by 2 Friday); 227 OI for $35 strike; 1 OI for $40 strike

Given the rapid price movement LMNX can make, it is interesting yet perhaps not surprising that more $40 calls are being purchased than even $30 puts. The number of calls for September, October and Jan ’21 all vastly outweigh the puts as well. It appears that option traders are extremely bullish on LMNX continuing its upward movement for the foreseeable future.  

Regarding shorts, according to shortsqueeze.com, LMNX has seen a 10% decrease in short interest, from 5,470,000 shares short to 4,900,000 shares short, now at 11.39% short percentage.

Earnings call transcript:

[https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/08/05/luminex-corp-de-lmnx-q2-2020-earnings-call-transcr.aspx](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/08/05/luminex-corp-de-lmnx-q2-2020-earnings-call-transcr.aspx)

I particularly like this portion of the CEO’s statement:

“We are very excited about the opportunity for this COVID-19 specific antibody tests in the market. We also submitted our **fourth assay** to the FDA for EUA clearances a few weeks ago, **a new NxTAG RPP plus SARS-CoV-2 consolidated panel**. Finally, we continue to work on a number of products in our VERIGENE family. We recently submitted SARS-CoV-2 stand-alone assay on VERIGENE I and planning to submit soon for an EUA for VERIGENE II Respiratory assay with the SARS-CoV-2 target.

We are in the process of **expanding** our total manufacturing capacity of all MDx assay **from approximately 1.8 million tests per quarter to approximately 3 million tests per quarter** as a result of **significant demand** for our product to assist in addressing the COVID-19 pandemic.”

Do they pay a dividend?  
 Luminex has been known to pay a quarterly dividend, most recently in Q2 2020 at 1.17% which had a June 18 ex-div and was payable July 9th.   

Who is their CEO?  
 Nachum Shamir is the current CEO/Chairman, and has been there since 2014. Prior to that he worked at IDB Holding from 2006 to 2014, and just prior to that in 2004/2005 he served as President of Kodak Versamark, Inc. (part of Eastman Kodak Company KODK). He currently receives a $743k salary, with total compensation of $3.36M which is roughly 25% lower than similar size companies. Mr. Shamir currently owns 0.41% of LMNX, and the only insider owning more (besides Mr. Loewenbaum) is the CFO/SVP Harriss Currie who has 0.54% ownership.

What does institutional ownership look like?  
 According to MarketBeat.com, Q1 saw 68M bought/26M sold by institutions. Q2 saw 56M bought, 50M sold, and thus far in Q3 114M bought with only 17M sold.   
 [https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/lmnx/institutional-ownership/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/lmnx/institutional-ownership/)

According to fintel.io:  
 “Luminex Corp. (US:LMNX) has 456 institutional owners and shareholders that have filed 13D/G or 13F forms with the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC). These institutions hold a total of 41,360,722 shares. Largest shareholders include BlackRock Inc., Vanguard Group Inc, RGM Capital, LLC, IJR - iShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF, Renaissance Technologies Llc, Dimensional Fund Advisors Lp, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, State Street Corp, Select Equity Group, L.P., and VTSMX - Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund Investor Shares.“  
 [https://fintel.io/so/us/lmnx](https://fintel.io/so/us/lmnx)

Why was there a drop recently after earnings, if they beat & are growing?  
 George Loewenbaum has been with the company for 25 years, and they announced his resignation. Additionally, there was insider selling which was detailed out in May, and Mr. Loewenbaum has also been selling off some of his shares. Interesting side note, Mr. Loewenbaum also serves on the board of 3D Systems Corporation which trades under DDD and does 3d printing.  

I do not believe the market cares about sentiment; in that the market makers/institutions/hedge funds are not sentimental.  Thus, I speculate the drop from $40 to $30 was largely due to the desire to get more shares at a cheaper price. If you really look at the institutional ownership, it’s currently 77.37% and growing every quarter this year.

Analyzing LMNX Stock Price

https://preview.redd.it/k89h61sbk7h51.jpg?width=2389&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=afe6e45d00c716527e61e4f79228fe1646b27406

Luminex would be $51 stock if it traded at the same p/s as [$TMO](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/TMO), or $47 if it traded at same p/b as [$ATRC](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/ATRC).

The stock is currently trading in an upward channel, with the current price very near the bottom channel support line. If the stock falls below $29.80, it may be headed for a further decline. While I do not know the future, many stocks have been sold off immediately after ER despite beating, only to immediately recover. A good example of this is Owens & Minor, Inc. (OMI ticker). They fell from $17 to $13, then rebounded back up to high $16s in the matter of 10 trading days (from fall to recovery).  

On Friday, it double bottomed around $30.50 and closed at $30.87, down 3.35% for the day. LMNX is a highly volatile stock, with 3 of the last 4 days seeing a +/- 3% movement. This appears to be quite normal for LMNX, and when it moves up, it does so sharply over a period of days or even weeks.   

Chart wise, D crossed above K on SlowStoch and RSI (14) is currently nearing oversold at 40.58. The MACD & Signal deviation are at 3x, which is the relatively high and unusual (-.648 macd/0.213 signal). LMNX also recently bounced off the lower Bollinger band, and closed just below the MA5 $31.22.

Huge growth and major institutional buying, with relatively little selling, makes this worth a closer look.

One final note I will make, are option calls open interest for next Friday, August 21st.  

For calls, there are:

44 OI for $30 strike; 408 OI for $35 strike; 1130 OI for $40 strike (increased by 9 Friday); 135 OI for $45 strike

For puts, there are: 338 OI for $30 strike (increased by 2 Friday); 227 OI for $35 strike; 1 OI for $40 strike

Given the rapid price movement LMNX can make, it is interesting yet perhaps not surprising that more $40 calls are being purchased than even $30 puts. The number of calls for September, October and Jan ’21 all vastly outweigh the puts as well. It appears that option traders are extremely bullish on LMNX continuing its upward movement for the foreseeable future.  

Regarding shorts, according to shortsqueeze.com, LMNX has seen a 10% decrease in short interest, from 5,470,000 shares short to 4,900,000 shares short, now at 11.39% short percentage.

TMO,wallstreetbets,The people that made the most money during the gold rush didn't mine for gold. They sold shovels.,"I've seen a lot of posts about people speculating which pharmaceutical company is going to make the next big vaccine or test for COVID-19. In my opinion, making bets like this is a total gamble, and these companies will fluctuate with news of trials that may or may not be true. **Buying calls on pharmaceutical companies is like trying to bet on a mining company during the gold rush; a total chance on who will strike gold and get rich.**

I propose an alternate play here. The companies that sell the equipment and supplies that make it possible for these companies to continue to do research and development. **Regardless of who comes up with a solution, there are a few companies making an absolute killing while all of this goes on. These are the shovel sellers.**

I'm going to share a couple of my plays, and I'd encourage others to share their thoughts or any other plays that fit into this category.

&#x200B;

**Play #1: Veeva Systems (VEEV)**

Veeva Systems creates software that is specifically tailored to the life sciences and pharmaceuticals industry. Their platform is used to manage clinical trials, have virtual meetings, manage customers and data, and more.

&#x200B;

Certain aspects of their platform such as Veeva Engage, a tool built on top of Zoom for meeting with Healthcare professionals, have seen insane growth in usage.[https://www.pulsedigital.co.uk/blog/post/covid-19-pandemic-leads-to-a-tenfold-increase-in-usage-of-veeva-engage](https://www.pulsedigital.co.uk/blog/post/covid-19-pandemic-leads-to-a-tenfold-increase-in-usage-of-veeva-engage)

The reason I like Veeva so much is that because they are in such a compliant industry, many parts of their platform have basically no competition. A great example of this is with their CRM. It can cost millions of dollars to buy a CRM system (i.e. Salesforce, Dynamics, Zoho, Hubspot, etc.) and customize it to your business. Veeva licensed Salesforce and customized it to the needs of an entire industry over a decade, to the point that it would almost impossible for their customers to build their own systems, or for another software company to make something that's up to par. They also have tons of cash and no debt, which is a major bonus.

Position: I've been holding 5/15 $190 calls for a couple weeks (already printing), and I plan to buy a few higher OTM calls  with strikes later this year. This is an extremely safe position (the stock not the FD) whether you're bullish or bearish on the market overall, so I expect more people to pile into Veeva.

**Play #2 - Thermo-Fisher Scientific (TMO)**

Thermo Fisher is a manufacturer and distributor of laboratory equipment and supplies.

Thermo Fisher supplies all of the tools necessary for laboratories to keep up production. This includes everything from test tubes and vials, to masks and PPE, to the heavy equipment used to test samples. They're even developing their own COVID-19 tests:

[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/thermo-fisher-scientific-receives-ce-060000782.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/thermo-fisher-scientific-receives-ce-060000782.html)

I like Thermo because they stand to make a killing even after a vaccine is found, because they sell equipment used in the manufacture of tests and vaccines that will be in high demand as production ramps up, regardless of who discovers the best method.

Positions: I have 6/19 $350 calls. I'm planning to buy more long-dated calls (probably Jan '22) that will cover through the manufacturing period.

Edit 2: Should have mentioned this before, but Thermo reports earning tomorrow (4/22), so you may way to hold out until after this to make a play unless yo want to take a short-term gamble.",3139,230,1587409281.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g4yxwg/the_people_that_made_the_most_money_during_the/,jlusales,"The people that made the most money during the gold rush didn't mine for gold. They sold shovels. I've seen a lot of posts about people speculating which pharmaceutical company is going to make the next big vaccine or test for COVID-19. In my opinion, making bets like this is a total gamble, and these companies will fluctuate with news of trials that may or may not be true. **Buying calls on pharmaceutical companies is like trying to bet on a mining company during the gold rush; a total chance on who will strike gold and get rich.**

I propose an alternate play here. The companies that sell the equipment and supplies that make it possible for these companies to continue to do research and development. **Regardless of who comes up with a solution, there are a few companies making an absolute killing while all of this goes on. These are the shovel sellers.**

I'm going to share a couple of my plays, and I'd encourage others to share their thoughts or any other plays that fit into this category.

&#x200B;

**Play #1: Veeva Systems (VEEV)**

Veeva Systems creates software that is specifically tailored to the life sciences and pharmaceuticals industry. Their platform is used to manage clinical trials, have virtual meetings, manage customers and data, and more.

&#x200B;

Certain aspects of their platform such as Veeva Engage, a tool built on top of Zoom for meeting with Healthcare professionals, have seen insane growth in usage.[https://www.pulsedigital.co.uk/blog/post/covid-19-pandemic-leads-to-a-tenfold-increase-in-usage-of-veeva-engage](https://www.pulsedigital.co.uk/blog/post/covid-19-pandemic-leads-to-a-tenfold-increase-in-usage-of-veeva-engage)

The reason I like Veeva so much is that because they are in such a compliant industry, many parts of their platform have basically no competition. A great example of this is with their CRM. It can cost millions of dollars to buy a CRM system (i.e. Salesforce, Dynamics, Zoho, Hubspot, etc.) and customize it to your business. Veeva licensed Salesforce and customized it to the needs of an entire industry over a decade, to the point that it would almost impossible for their customers to build their own systems, or for another software company to make something that's up to par. They also have tons of cash and no debt, which is a major bonus.

Position: I've been holding 5/15 $190 calls for a couple weeks (already printing), and I plan to buy a few higher OTM calls  with strikes later this year. This is an extremely safe position (the stock not the FD) whether you're bullish or bearish on the market overall, so I expect more people to pile into Veeva.

**Play #2 - Thermo-Fisher Scientific (TMO)**

Thermo Fisher is a manufacturer and distributor of laboratory equipment and supplies.

Thermo Fisher supplies all of the tools necessary for laboratories to keep up production. This includes everything from test tubes and vials, to masks and PPE, to the heavy equipment used to test samples. They're even developing their own COVID-19 tests:

[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/thermo-fisher-scientific-receives-ce-060000782.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/thermo-fisher-scientific-receives-ce-060000782.html)

I like Thermo because they stand to make a killing even after a vaccine is found, because they sell equipment used in the manufacture of tests and vaccines that will be in high demand as production ramps up, regardless of who discovers the best method.

Positions: I have 6/19 $350 calls. I'm planning to buy more long-dated calls (probably Jan '22) that will cover through the manufacturing period.

**TL:DR** There are a few companies that supply the pharmaceutical industry. I've found that betting on these is a hell of a lot safer than betting on individual companies to develop a test or vaccine.

If the patent optioned by SPEX which is a combination of SARS and MERS treatments does work, the constituent inhibitors will be needed (AFAIK,  AGN, LILLY, NVS) and antivirals will be administered no matter which inihibitor they choose (INO, MRNA, NOVAVAX, GILD, NVAX). Bad news though, most of the obscure picks here are DOWN, not up.... so maybe I should throw the whole DD away**

While everyone is looking at puts, there are few opportunities for calls on companies that could help cure this virus. There are (at least) 3 obvious companies to buy calls on -- companies producing tests, vaccines, cures. Here's a list of the ones I can remember easily (in order of confidence/recent price moves):

Tests:

- OPK
- AIM
- CODX
- DGX
- TMO
- ILMN
- HOLX
- VIVO


Vaccines:

- INO
- MRNA
- GILD
- JNJ

Cure:

- TAK

Obviously, the holy grail is the cure, but it would be foolish to put all your hope there.

All that's well and good, but here's the real juicy bit. There's a story circulating on Reddit right now (Hi chinese overlords?) [about a university in xiamen creating a 29 minute test](https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.shine.cn%2Fnews%2Fnation%2F2003073683%2F). Some more searching has revealed that this tech *might* be the exact same that has been in use [in Israel](https://www.israel21c.org/israeli-company-develops-rapid-diagnostic-kit-for-covid-19/) ([short reddit discussion here](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/ffpjn3/xiamen_university_steals_coronavirus_testing_idea/)). I'm too dumb to find an entity that I can buy calls on related to these but let's keep going -- because the closest I'm finding is SPEX. The [patent that SPEX executed an option on](https://patents.justia.com/patent/10434116) suggests that it is a *cure* that is based on previous SARS + MERS progress. Here's the TL;DR:

> The present invention provides methods for treating a coronavirus infection. For example, treatment may be effected by administering a neurotransmitter inhibitor, a signaling kinase inhibitor, an estrogen receptor inhibitor, a DNA metabolism inhibitor or an anti-parasitic agent. Also provided are methods for treating a coronavirus infection in which an anti-viral drug also is administered during any of the described methods.

The patent is somewhat vague (and I don't understand all of it) but it works with a few steps:

- administer a neurotransmitter inhibitor (chlorpromazine hydrochloride, triflupromazine hydrochloride, clomipramine hydrochloride, thiethylperazine maleate, chlorphenoxamine hydrochloride, promethazine hydrochloride, fluphenazine hydrochloride, thiothixene, fluspirilene, and benztropine mesylate)
- administer a kinase signaling inhibitor (imatinib mesylate (Gleevec), nilotinib (Tasigna), and dasatinib)
- administer a estrogen receptor inhibitor/anti-parasitic agent/dna metabolism inhibitor (gemcitabine hydrochloride)
- administer an antiviral *during* the methods above (interferon, ribavirin, adefovir, tenofovir, acyclovir, brivudin, cidofovir, fomivirsen, foscarnet, ganciclovir, penciclovir, amantadine, rimantadine and zanamivir)

The way they are testing for it is that they administer 290 compounds, 33 of which activate when MERS, 102 activate for SARS, and 28 that activate when both MERS *or* SARS are present (the math doesn't add up, so not sure if a bunch of the compounds just don't activate consistently or if I misread). Read the patent for more, but basically, this cure is a mix of approaches effective on SARS/MERS.

Now the question is, what company sells these? Because they're about to get a lot of orders:

- <x> hydrochlorides lead me to [promethazine hydrochloride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promethazine) because it sounded familiar, and IMO it's way more widely available than the other stuff -- But all I can find are companies that *stopped* selling it -- Allergan (AGN)
- gemcitabine hydrochloride (https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/daf/index.cfm?event=overview.process&ApplNo=020509) - LILLY
- imatnib (https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/search.cfm?labeltype=all&query=Imatinib) -- lots of companies, but the only one I recognize is Novartis, and Mylan
- antivirals (got lazy at this point) -- https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/01/26/5-biotech-stocks-to-watch-with-the-coronavirus-sca.aspx (lists the ones we already know, INO, MRNA, NOVAVAX, GILD, NVAX)

**AND HERE IS WHERE THE D GOES SOFT**

Unfortunately, all of the more obscure plays are *slightly red* right now -- I don't know if I'm ahead, or if none of this actually means anything. If anyone is a biologist/researcher in here, please help out because I spend my time touching keyboards, not pipettes. Specifically:

- There have to be massive amounts of companies I'm missing, please help if you know any more (even ones I've just left out here).
- Am I right on the idea?
- Which companies specialize in DNA testing? The tests that Israel is doing (and supposedly xiamen just started doing) are DNA based -- I can't tell if this is the same -- but it [looks like they are](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_transcription_polymerase_chain_reaction) -- calls should maybe be also going on the biggest companies that do this kind of testing (TMO, CODX, ILMN)

I am not your financial advisor, do with this information what you wish -- do your own research and please report back if you see anything juicy.

What is on everyone's radar for today's trading day ahead here at r/wallstreetbets?

TMO,wallstreetbets,Investing in Cannabis: a brief overview of a true YOLO opportunity,"We are all extremely lucky to be witnessing the end of marijuana prohibition in the developed world. This is a market that will forever change the economic landscape for the countries involved in bringing about a legal marketplace. For investment purposes The Marijuana sector is comprised of two main markets at the moment IMO. There is Canada and there is the United States. 

In Canada marijuana has had a strong country wide recognized legal marijuana system built for corporate control since the introduction of the MMPR in 2013. Provinces and their national govt have been in lockstep throughout (mostly) and this has created stability for investors. This has led to companies such as Tilray and Canopy Growth Corp and a few other small corporate entities sucking up Billions of real investment dollars from individuals and even [Fortune 500 beverage companies](https://www.newcannabisventures.com/canopy-growth-closes-5-billion-constellation-brands-investment-transaction/). Accordingly this resulted in a gross overvaluation of these companies that operate legal cannabis operations. Take a look at these [financial reports](https://www.canopygrowth.com/investors/financials/) and tell me if this seems like an effectively managed and run outfit. No one cares about what I see as fairly obvious poor management and at its peak this company was worth over 10 Billion in market cap.

In the US everything is fragmented by unique state laws. The one unifying law is the schedule 1 status that dictates federal illegality. This is where opportunity for us lies. Due to this status that’s purely [fucking stupid](https://www.dea.gov/drug-scheduling) investment banks and corporations such as the one that gifted Canopy 4 Billion can not reasonably invest into these companies that are in many ways far outperforming Canopy at the time of that multi billion dollar investment. All while existing in far more attractive markets once the concern of federal interference is lifted. Imagine investing in UBER or Facebook far before a bank or large stakeholder gave them billions of dollars in return for a large interest of the company. This is where the marijuana industry is at in the United States. You can invest before the banks and financial institutions.

I don’t want to go into too much detail about the Canadian market but the point is that the entire nation is comparable to the state of California with absolutely none of the branding potential due to many different factors. Canada may lead in the international market opportunities but its apparent that that is slowly developing and not as attractive as Canadian companies may hope it to be [link](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/monazhang/2017/11/07/global-marijuana-market-31-billion-investors-cautious/amp/). imo the US is a far more attractive business space for cannabis due to available expendable income and branding potential. 

At the end of the day investing in this sector is about finding the next McDonald’s or Starbucks. Anyone can sell a cup of coffee or a shitty cheeseburger (or mediocre weed). Yet here are two mega billion dollar corporations that have billions of people across the world addicted to their product. This is what I’m looking for. As someone who is pretty experienced trying different quality weed;  in my opinion the company that takes the lead is going to be about delivering quality of product (unlike Starbucks and McDonalds) and the leader is far from established at the moment. 

I was going to make this a lot more detailed with more links but I’m going to leave a lot of the digging to you. Most of the info you need is going to be in the corporate documents. You should take the time and learn to read 10-q, k, and all corporate documents when making an investment of this length. I’ll start taking profits after large institutions begin making sizable investments similar to constellation’s. Could be a year, or 5. I really can’t say with certainty but I do feel it’s coming sooner rather than later with bipartisan legislation such as the [S.T.A.T.E.S. Act](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/STATES_Act) being introduced. The political aspect of this is continuously moving in the right direction and there is strong indication that big banks are pushing the right people towards cannabis reform with Trump signaling his support as well as other traditionally conservative (towards drug policy) politicians.

(TCNNF) The one I like the most is Trulieve [link](https://vimeo.com/313083903). They dominate the Florida market with over 500k sq ft of grow space and soon to be 30 dispensaries. No other company dominates a region like trulieve and they are doing it in one of the most attractive marijuana markets in the world with tourism and retirees everywhere to give them their expendable income once full legalization comes into effect. Financials are attractive [link](https://www.trulieve.com/investors). The only public company in the entire industry worldwide with financials that look like an actually profitable and compelling investment. More than that is their philosophy of business. They don’t make massive acquisitions. Their 4 million dollar investment in Massachusetts (100k sq ft cultivation license + 3 dispensaries I believe) can easily turn into 4 million a quarter in roughly a year. This is good for shareholders which btw is majority insider controlled and locked up until July [link](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/trulieve-cannabis-corp-announces-voluntary-lock-up-agreements-with-company-founders-804831853.html). Right now fully diluted the company is valued around 1B in market cap. Compared to peers this is a steal. Canopy saw 10B and this company had better revs last reported quarter in 2018 (annual report due on April 30) not to mention strong profits and all the other important metrics that put its peers to shame. Compared to canopy’s valuation you can see why I’m so excited about this opportunity.

I think the fear for investors here is the market is immature and people are doubting they can hold onto their lead. Florida has previously capped stores to 30 and many other operators had yet to build out. Trulieve however just won an important suit that has ruled that cap unconstitutional [link](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.orlandosentinel.com/news/politics/political-pulse/os-ne-judge-marijuana-dispensaries-cap-20190204-story,amp.html). I think it’s too late for competitors and it’s trulieves market to lose based on government and legal actions recently. The cost to entry is high and every other competitor is operating in debt and making acquisitions that cost hundreds of millions of dollars instead of organic growth. 

The other issue is that they don’t have the license getting skills in other states and will have to make large acquisitions going forward, which may be true but I think patience will reveal opportunity like in Massachusetts. They will target cheaper license getters or struggling license holders without the means or knowledge to buildout and use their profits while their competitors struggle with debt. This is my yolo essentially. I’ll diversify but due to share structure and insider control as well as the other factors this is the most attractive company in the US by a large margin imo. I think anything under $15 is a good buy and don’t think it stays under $20 much longer.

(GTBIF) The next one I like is green thumb industries [link](https://investors.gtigrows.com/investors/overview/default.aspx). This one has been making acquisitions that have been [massive](https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/11/13/1650439/0/en/Green-Thumb-Industries-Inc-GTI-Expands-with-the-Acquisition-of-Integral-Associates-Nevada-s-Top-Cannabis-Operator.html) but they aren’t stupid moves unlike some of its peers (medmen) who have spent egregious amounts on unestablished license holders. They bought a [company](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/essence-cannabis-dispensary-awarded-new-licenses-to-expand-to-california-300768648.html) that afterwards won a very unique and competitive license in West Hollywood. They also won a very competitive and valuable license in [New Jersey](https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/12/17/1668365/0/en/National-Cannabis-Company-Green-Thumb-Industries-GTI-Awarded-Cultivation-Processing-and-Retail-License-in-New-Jersey.html). This is the key to long term growth in the industry while maintaining shareholder value. A license can cost a few million vs buying a license holder which can cost tens of millions or hundreds of millions depending on development so whoever has the best license getters in the industry are going to be at a serious advantage for long term growth. Financials aren’t horrible compared to the rest of the sector and they are positioned well in Illinois with around 100k sq ft in grow space. Illinois just elected a pro legalization governor. Market cap is around 1.5 B. overall I trust this company and its branding efforts (rise dispensaries) to make it an established player in the market. They are however in buildout mode so financials might not look as pretty this year and dilution will be happening and therefore will see good buying opportunities this year imo. I’d be happy to pick some more up around $7.

Something to keep in mind when doing your own due diligence is these m.s.o. (Multi state operators) like to count their unbuilt licenses as if they exist. In Florida for example, it seems companies were granted 30 dispensaries by default so a lot of mso, without even building out 1, have greatly inflated their dispensary numbers. Focus on who actually has the most buildings functioning and distributing product. That will tell you who is ahead. I personally am focused on companies that dominate an area which doesn’t necessarily mean they will have the most dispensaries-just the best locations to saturate a market. 

(CURLF) I don’t like curaleaf [link](https://content.equisolve.net/curaleaf/news/2018-11-26_Curaleaf_Reports_Third_Quarter_2018_Financial_and__29.pdf) because of overvaluation (mc around 2.5B) but it’s probably wise to pick up a piece of these guys when the opportunity arises. They were early in New Jersey which is a very attractive market and bring in significant revenue. They have 20 operational dispensaries in FL and over 650k sq ft of cultivation space across all states they operate in according to their investor presentation. It will be telling if they can make a significant dent to trulieves footprint in Florida or if they will be The Burger King to trulieves McDonalds. Trulieve has maintained over 60% of market share in Florida so I question Curaleafs potential to outcompete competitors in other states as well. They also are initiating a share [buyback](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/curaleaf-announces-launch-of-share-buyback-program-300760620.html) which at this stage is a huge red flag while green thumb is acquiring serious license getters and Florida competitor trulieve is opening 6 stores in the upcoming few months. I’m looking for a strong dip in the upcoming year and might buy some around $4.

(Acrgf) Acreage has made some dumbfounding decisions that include millions of dollars of investment in the state of Iowa which has only legalized cbd and in general have fairly unattractive locations including Oregon and Maine [link](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/oregons-weed-glut-what-happens-to-excess-pot-697985/amp/). They also missed the boat in Florida and look a little desperate with this [acquisition](https://www.newcannabisventures.com/acreage-holdings-enters-florida-medical-cannabis-market-with-67-million-acquisition-natures-way/) made recently. Imo They are b listers from my due diligence (Burger King might be too much of a compliment) but they’re the best politically connected [link](https://m.benzinga.com/article/12716495) and are well positioned financially to be a force in the sector. Already distributing in Jersey (125k sqft cultivation facility) which is big. If I see stupid moves I stay away especially if they are already overvalued [link](http://investors.acreageholdings.com/file/Index?KeyFile=395942626) but this should definitely be on your radar (also has 100k sqft cultivation in NY) . This thing trades strong and I think a lot of big money is behind it. I will probably diversify and pick up some when an opportunity presents itself. Hoping to have an opportunity to buy around ~$12-15 because I don’t think they are deserving of a market cap of more than about 1.5B at the moment and currently are trading around a 3B market cap.

Another thing is to do your due diligence in each states cannabis economy as each is incredibly unique. Right now Oregon, Washington and Colorado are not business friendly (in terms of helping a balance sheet look nicer) even though Colorado and Washington are very attractive revenue wise. Some states limit monopolies or have no limit in dispensaries/cultivation which reduces economic upside at the moment. Maryland has a limit (cant find a link so might need to fact check me on this) on how much one company can own of the state which will be interesting to see how it’s upheld as the market merges. Cali has overtaxed everything so the black market continues to be very influential there but whoever takes the lead in this state (medmen currently) will be a formidable force as the black market slowly fades from existence. Nevada is a good economy due to limiting the licenses given out and flower prices were rising for a while. Vegas is huge from a branding perspective. Green thumb is the leader here after their big acquisition. Jersey is just getting around to implementing medical expansion (thanks to fat bastard aka Chris Christie) so companies there haven’t even capitalized on that population density yet. Most of this is really common sense and comes down to basic supply vs. demand economics. The northeast especially, where there are tons of non smokers without access to quality black market connects are going to pour hundreds of dollars into brick and mortar stores each month imo so I’m paying close attention to Mass/NJ/NY in the coming year to see who takes the lead there.


(MMNFF) Medmen is garbage and idc to go in depth on why [link](https://equity.guru/2018/05/28/medmen-goes-public-tuesday-three-executives-will-make-money-deal/). It would be a lengthy write up. They have the best market penetration in Cali so far and I do think they will be relevant in 10 years but investment potential isn’t as attractive as their peers. Insiders sold out for a reason in my opinion [link](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.businessinsider.com/marijuana-retailer-medmen-acquires-pharmacann-for-682-million-2018-10). this acquisition is going to take a decade if not more to pay off assuming it does. Just horrible mismanagement of shareholder value IMO. 

(CRLBF) Cresco labs are Chicago based and have focused their efforts in Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Ohio [link](https://investors.crescolabs.com/investors/overview/default.aspx) Management seems to be top tier but I think it’s a little pricy at the moment (~2B) for what they own. The main guy sits on a committee with newly elected Pritzker in Illinois (140k sq ft cultivation in IL) and they will be major players I think [link](https://investors.crescolabs.com/investors/press-releases/press-release-details/2018/Cresco-Labs-Co-founder-and-CEO-Charles-Bachtell-Appointed-to-Cannabis-Legalization-Subcommittee-of-Illinois-Governor-elect-JB-Pritzkers-Transition-Team/default.aspx). I’m looking to diversify with these guys when an opportunity presents itself. Hoping for a chance around $5.

(ITHUF) Another interesting company is Ianthus [link](https://www.ianthuscapital.com/investors). They recently merged with MPX and imo it has legitimized their future. Ianthus holds attractive licenses in NY and FL but has no proven growth or brand perception. Mpx on The other hand has strong brand perception (although recently they’ve been getting poor reviews on products) and proven growth and also holds some attractive licenses in AZ, MD, and NJ among others [link](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.pressofatlanticcity.com/news/two-new-medical-marijuana-dispensaries-coming-to-atlantic-city-vineland/article_8bceb880-437d-5d4e-ab89-7429c53d7fc5.amp.html).
Together I think they will be a value buy at some point. Unfortunately both don’t have enough operating capital to fund their growth and will need funding to execute and fulfill their potential. when an opportunity presents itself I’ll buy a small piece for diversification. I’m looking for sub $3 myself.

(HTHHF) There is also Harvest Health and Recreation [link](https://www.harvestinc.com/industry-experience/). Not very familiar with them but they seem to be strong license getters and have good reviews. Definitely overpriced at the moment. I’ll look for a buy op under $4. 


A company to look out for is Columbia Care [link](https://www.col-care.com). They have a huge presence in the northeast and have yet to go public. Won a New Jersey license recently. 

(DXBRF) There is also Dixie brands [link](http://dixieelixirs.com/ir-dashboard/). This is where long term future is in the industry. Beverages are a socialized means of getting fucked up. The beverage leader will normalize getting high. Right now that’s Dixie. My concern here is this is decades away from normalizing. I don’t think the market for drinks is as attractive an investment short term as the actual infrastructure to grow the plant. Also my opinion is established brands such as Coca Cola will simply come in and have better brand recognition immediately. Nothing Dixie or any edible manufacturer is doing is necessarily a secret or patentable from my understanding so all the big beverage players have to do is hire the right people and they will immediately dominate a company like Dixie. 

Something else to look out for is investor presentations and revenue forecasts. I’ve seen quite a few but the one that stands out the most is acreages that was just absolute bullshit. Do not under any circumstance trust guidance from companies. I think revenues will grow slower than most will admit but the market will continue to overvalue these companies as we get closer to large capital investing in the US cannabis space. Companies that have established presence in growing markets such as Trulieve I’ll trust far more than unestablished companies with poor footing like Acreage to give accurate projections. At the end of the day there are too many variables in a completely new market segment to rely on company projections.

Other ancillary companies for “safer” investment include Scott’s Miracle Grow (SMG) which I think will dominate the self grow industry as well as the commercial growing infrastructure based on some of their recent acquisitions. The other sector I’m somewhat familiar with is mass spectrometry. Labs to test marijuana composition are going to be a huge need and mass spectrometers and liquid chromatography will be in high demand. I know Waters (WAT) specializes in spectrometry. Also (TMO) Thermo Fisher and (PKI) PerkinElmer for laboratory needs. I haven’t actually done my due diligence on these guys financials and fundamentals though.


That’s it I think. Some smaller players exist but these are the big boys that have the most growth potential. If you have a thought, question or comment about anything I’d love to hear it, especially if you are familiar with any of these companies or have your own personal insights to share. There will likely be more relevant companies that go public so I’ll keep my eyes open and let you know if I see anything worthwhile. I’m looking forward to the market consolidating when bigger money gets to join in. These are just my opinions so do your own due diligence and best of luck!

",1066,184,1549915669.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/apkd46/investing_in_cannabis_a_brief_overview_of_a_true/,peanutbuttercunt,"Investing in Cannabis: a brief overview of a true YOLO opportunity We are all extremely lucky to be witnessing the end of marijuana prohibition in the developed world. This is a market that will forever change the economic landscape for the countries involved in bringing about a legal marketplace. For investment purposes The Marijuana sector is comprised of two main markets at the moment IMO. There is Canada and there is the United States. 

In Canada marijuana has had a strong country wide recognized legal marijuana system built for corporate control since the introduction of the MMPR in 2013. Provinces and their national govt have been in lockstep throughout (mostly) and this has created stability for investors. This has led to companies such as Tilray and Canopy Growth Corp and a few other small corporate entities sucking up Billions of real investment dollars from individuals and even [Fortune 500 beverage companies](https://www.newcannabisventures.com/canopy-growth-closes-5-billion-constellation-brands-investment-transaction/). Accordingly this resulted in a gross overvaluation of these companies that operate legal cannabis operations. Take a look at these [financial reports](https://www.canopygrowth.com/investors/financials/) and tell me if this seems like an effectively managed and run outfit. No one cares about what I see as fairly obvious poor management and at its peak this company was worth over 10 Billion in market cap.

In the US everything is fragmented by unique state laws. The one unifying law is the schedule 1 status that dictates federal illegality. This is where opportunity for us lies. Due to this status that’s purely [fucking stupid](https://www.dea.gov/drug-scheduling) investment banks and corporations such as the one that gifted Canopy 4 Billion can not reasonably invest into these companies that are in many ways far outperforming Canopy at the time of that multi billion dollar investment. All while existing in far more attractive markets once the concern of federal interference is lifted. Imagine investing in UBER or Facebook far before a bank or large stakeholder gave them billions of dollars in return for a large interest of the company. This is where the marijuana industry is at in the United States. You can invest before the banks and financial institutions.

I don’t want to go into too much detail about the Canadian market but the point is that the entire nation is comparable to the state of California with absolutely none of the branding potential due to many different factors. Canada may lead in the international market opportunities but its apparent that that is slowly developing and not as attractive as Canadian companies may hope it to be [link](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/monazhang/2017/11/07/global-marijuana-market-31-billion-investors-cautious/amp/). imo the US is a far more attractive business space for cannabis due to available expendable income and branding potential. 

At the end of the day investing in this sector is about finding the next McDonald’s or Starbucks. Anyone can sell a cup of coffee or a shitty cheeseburger (or mediocre weed). Yet here are two mega billion dollar corporations that have billions of people across the world addicted to their product. This is what I’m looking for. As someone who is pretty experienced trying different quality weed;  in my opinion the company that takes the lead is going to be about delivering quality of product (unlike Starbucks and McDonalds) and the leader is far from established at the moment. 

I was going to make this a lot more detailed with more links but I’m going to leave a lot of the digging to you. Most of the info you need is going to be in the corporate documents. You should take the time and learn to read 10-q, k, and all corporate documents when making an investment of this length. I’ll start taking profits after large institutions begin making sizable investments similar to constellation’s. Could be a year, or 5. I really can’t say with certainty but I do feel it’s coming sooner rather than later with bipartisan legislation such as the [S.T.A.T.E.S. Act](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/STATES_Act) being introduced. The political aspect of this is continuously moving in the right direction and there is strong indication that big banks are pushing the right people towards cannabis reform with Trump signaling his support as well as other traditionally conservative (towards drug policy) politicians.

The only public company in the entire industry worldwide with financials that look like an actually profitable and compelling investment. More than that is their philosophy of business. They don’t make massive acquisitions. Their 4 million dollar investment in Massachusetts (100k sq ft cultivation license + 3 dispensaries I believe) can easily turn into 4 million a quarter in roughly a year. This is good for shareholders which btw is majority insider controlled and locked up until July [link](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/trulieve-cannabis-corp-announces-voluntary-lock-up-agreements-with-company-founders-804831853.html).

(DXBRF) There is also Dixie brands [link](http://dixieelixirs.com/ir-dashboard/). This is where long term future is in the industry. Beverages are a socialized means of getting fucked up. The beverage leader will normalize getting high. Right now that’s Dixie. My concern here is this is decades away from normalizing. I don’t think the market for drinks is as attractive an investment short term as the actual infrastructure to grow the plant. Also my opinion is established brands such as Coca Cola will simply come in and have better brand recognition immediately. Nothing Dixie or any edible manufacturer is doing is necessarily a secret or patentable from my understanding so all the big beverage players have to do is hire the right people and they will immediately dominate a company like Dixie. 

Something else to look out for is investor presentations and revenue forecasts. I’ve seen quite a few but the one that stands out the most is acreages that was just absolute bullshit. Do not under any circumstance trust guidance from companies. I think revenues will grow slower than most will admit but the market will continue to overvalue these companies as we get closer to large capital investing in the US cannabis space. Companies that have established presence in growing markets such as Trulieve I’ll trust far more than unestablished companies with poor footing like Acreage to give accurate projections. At the end of the day there are too many variables in a completely new market segment to rely on company projections.

Other ancillary companies for “safer” investment include Scott’s Miracle Grow (SMG) which I think will dominate the self grow industry as well as the commercial growing infrastructure based on some of their recent acquisitions. The other sector I’m somewhat familiar with is mass spectrometry. Labs to test marijuana composition are going to be a huge need and mass spectrometers and liquid chromatography will be in high demand. I know Waters (WAT) specializes in spectrometry. Also (TMO) Thermo Fisher and (PKI) PerkinElmer for laboratory needs. I haven’t actually done my due diligence on these guys financials and fundamentals though.


That’s it I think. Some smaller players exist but these are the big boys that have the most growth potential. If you have a thought, question or comment about anything I’d love to hear it, especially if you are familiar with any of these companies or have your own personal insights to share. There will likely be more relevant companies that go public so I’ll keep my eyes open and let you know if I see anything worthwhile. I’m looking forward to the market consolidating when bigger money gets to join in. These are just my opinions so do your own due diligence and best of luck!

#Trading Update

*  What’s happening this morning? There were a bunch of headlines but the broader US
narrative isn’t changing dramatically (US S&P futures are flat-to-up 1 point). The main eco
highlight this morning was the China Sept inflation numbers (CPI was inline while PPI
firmed by more than expected). Recall it was the China Aug inflation numbers back on 9/11
that kicked off the recent reflation trade. Central bank messaging was very mixed over the
weekend as a slew of officials spoke on the sidelines of the IMF/World Bank meetings; the
coming meetings are likely to bring tightening rhetoric/actions (ECB tapering guidance
10/26, BOE hike 11/2, FOMC hike 12/13) but officials remain concerned about the state of
global inflation (and Draghi emphasized on more than one occasion how ECB ZIRP would
likely stay in place for some time after the end of the LSAP). A Bloomberg article this
morning talks about how the ECB may run out of QE capacity soon (the limit may be EU2.5T
but the ECB will have bought EU2.3T by the end of this year). On the political front, US Sen.
Susan Collins said she would likely vote “yes” on this week’s budget resolution (passage is
necessary for tax but this is a relatively minor step in the overall process), the Catalonia
situation remains unresolved as the region failed to clarify whether it intended to declare
independence (it faces a new deadline this Thurs morning), tensions flared in Iraq as gov’t
forces moved to recapture Kurdish-held oil fields and a military base near Kirkuk (this news
has oil up ~1% this morning), and polls in Japan point to a strong victory for Abe’s coalition
(the election is Sun 10/22). Stocks in Asia generally did well – TPX +0.62%, NKY +0.47%,
Hang Seng +0.76%, HSCEI +0.72%, SHCOMP -0.36%, Taiwan +0.47%, Korea +0.26%,
Australia +0.56%, and India up ~60bp. Tech stocks in Korea continued to bleed lower
(Hynix -2.2%, Samsung Electronics -0.15%) while they generally saw gains in Taiwan (Largan
+4.05%, Hon Hai +1.4%, Quanta +7%, TSMC +0.21%, etc.). Europe’s major indices are flatto-
up small; basic resources are the big upside standout (SXPP +1.6% - it was bolstered Fri
on the China import numbers and the PPI figure out of the country is helping this morning)
while chemicals, media, healthcare, and energy are all doing well too; industrials, staples,
tech, and utilities are small laggards. Convatec Group PLC is down ~20% after issuing a
profit warning and Kuehne + Nagel is weak on earnings.
o Tactically fade reflation as narrative begins fraying at the margin; 2-10 TSY spread
just a few BPs from hitting 52w tights – the reflation narrative has enjoyed several
weeks of uninterruptedly favorable news, including firming inflation, solid real
growth, expansionary fiscal policy announcements, and hawkish CB
rhetoric/decisions. However, the news is beginning to turn more neutral at the
margin and this could cause pro-reflation themes to consolidate (at least).
*  Calendar of events for the week of Mon 10/16 – the main focus this week will be on
earnings, China, and US taxes. The China National Congress kicks off Wed 10/18 and the
country will be publishing a lot of eco data (inflation out Mon morning 10/16 and Q3 GDP
along w/Sept retail sales/IP/FAI out Thurs morning 10/19). Investors will keep an eye on
North Korea as media reports suggest the country could fire off some missiles around the
China Congress. In the US investors will be digesting earnings (the week of 10/16 is the first
busy one of the CQ3 season) and macro news should be limited aside from some Fed
speakers (including Yellen who speaks Fri 10/20 after the close). The US tax process will
continue w/the Senate voting on a budget resolution (likely Thurs 10/19) - passage is
expected but the final vote will likely be close; Rand Paul seems a hard “no” while McCain
and a few others are question marks; investors will be watching to see if any Democrats
cross the aisle. Keep in mind that the Senate budget resolution will need to be reconciled
w/the one from the House. Finally, the EU Leaders Summit runs 10/19-20 and the Japanese
snap election takes place Sun 10/22.
*  Calendar for Mon 10/16 – the focus will be on earnings (SCHW pre-open and BRO, CE, IEX,
NAVI, NFLX, Rio Tinto, RT, and SONC after the close).

#Top Headlines for Monday

*  Economic data/monetary policy recap for Mon 10/16 – the main highlight this morning
were China inflation numbers and the figures were generally solid (http://bit.ly/2yk55wf).
CPI for Sept was largely inline (+1.6%) while PPI firmed by more than anticipated (+6.9% vs.
JPM +6.3% and vs. the St +6.4%).
o Central bank leadership uncertainty – Reuters discusses how the world’s major
central banks may all see leadership changes over the next 1-2 years. The Fed,
BOJ, and PBOC may all have new leaders in early ’18 while Draghi is due to depart

o Central bankers adopt dovish tone regarding policy at weekend IMF/World Bank
meetings given tepid inflation trends – “central bankers cling to stimulus amid
weak inflation” – WSJ http://on.wsj.com/2gIt6TW
o Rosengren said in an interview Friday that a Fed rate hike in Dec remained likely.
“A failure to tighten would risk both the labor market and financial prices getting
into an area where we would have to react more quickly, and that would increase
the probability that we end up having a recession” (WSJ
http://on.wsj.com/2ieTh88); Rosengren added that he anticipates 3-4 hikes next
year (Reuters http://reut.rs/2xIze41).
o ECB running out of QE capacity – total ECB bond purchases will hit EU2.28T by the
end of ’17 and some within the central bank think the ultimate limit is only EU2.5T
(meaning it may only be able to purchase an additional ~EU200B worth of bonds in
2018) – Bloomberg. https://bloom.bg/2xIiBFP

would be taken as a declaration of secession and invite reprisal from Madrid. Catalonia
now has until Thurs morning to provide additional clarity. WSJ.
http://on.wsj.com/2gdue15
*  Iraq tensions escalate - Iraqi forces moved to recapture Kurdish-held oil fields and a military

*  GE – the FT speculates on a dividend cut at GE – “GE is failing to cover its dividend
payments from its core operating cash flows, a position that is ultimately unsustainable”; GE
reports earnings Fri 10/20 and will update investors on 11/13; if the 11/13 restructuring
plan isn’t aggressive enough, GE’s new mgmt. team could face pressure to break the
company apart – FT http://on.ft.com/2kStpzO

a sale – NY Post. http://nyp.st/2wXryeB
Top Headlines from the Weekend
*  Sentiment – the cover article in this week’s Barron’s, entitled “Echoes of the 1987 Crash”
(http://bit.ly/2gjdXeu), can hardly be accused of optimism (it focuses on the market’s
structural changes and the rise of technology, including quant-based strategies and ETFs,
and how this could sow the seeds for an ’87-like crash) but its sentiments aren’t necessarily
unique either. The recent Economist title (from 10/7) lamented elevated asset valuations
(“The bull market in everything” http://econ.st/2xVXOjv) and warned of what will happen
once central banks begin withdrawing liquidity. BLK’s Larry Fink on Friday warned that risks
in the financial system at present are comparable to 2007 levels (http://reut.rs/2zmk5ax).
o Investors are right to be nervous but not necessarily because of technology or
central banks. Rather, the fact the economy is late-cycle with valuations near peak
levels is the main source of risk when it comes to equities. However, late-cycle
doesn’t mean end-cycle (as discussed in this JPMorgan note http://bit.ly/2wTZRCK)
and the absence of gross imbalances suggests a downturn isn’t imminent while
multiples can easily expand a few additional turns (and each turn means ~140 SPX
points given current earnings estimates while tax may add ~$7-10+ to EPS).
o Flow vs. stock – central bank liquidity. The Wall St narrative when it comes to
central banks and LSAPs tends to emphasize the “flow” piece of the equation (i.e.
the actual buying of assets) but it is in fact the ownership of assets (“stock”) that
acts as the mechanism for accommodation. Therefore rather than focus on central
bank buying to gauge the appropriation of liquidity it is more critical to assess
balance sheet size and on that basis central banks don’t appear on the cusp of an
acute liquidity withdrawal (as discussed in this JPMorgan note – G4 CB balance
sheets will be little changed over the next 3-4 years http://bit.ly/2xAACJL).
*  Yellen delivered comments Sun 10/15 in conjunction w/the IMF/World Bank meetings in
Washington. Overall her speech echoed many of the same sentiments she’s expressed in
recent communications and the a rate hike on 12/13 still seems likely. “Economic activity
in the United States has been growing moderately so far this year, and the labor market has
continued to strengthen”. Yellen says the recent storms will likely depress economic activity
but only temporarily (she thinks jobs growth will rebound from the depressed -33K pace of
Sept). “Wage indicators have been mixed, and the most recent news, on average hourly
earnings through September, was encouraging”. Yellen thinks inflation will firm from the
current soft trend (“my best guess is that these soft readings will not persist, and with the
ongoing strengthening of labor markets, I expect inflation to move higher next year”)
although she does acknowledge that something more structural may be occurring (“the
fact that a number of other advanced economies are also experiencing persistently low
inflation understandably adds to the sense among many analysts that something more
structural may be going on…. we will be paying close attention to the inflation data in the
months ahead”). http://bit.ly/2ykNjZM
o Kuroda spoke over the weekend in Washington and said the BOJ would continue
pursuing an aggressive monetary easing policy. “Achieving the 2% target is still a
long way off”. WSJ. http://on.wsj.com/2kPwAZ3
o Draghi spoke positively about Eurozone growth but he reiterated a cautious view
on inflation; Draghi said underlying inflation remains too weak and as a result the
ECB would need to continue providing large degrees of monetary accomodation.
WSJ http://on.wsj.com/2yLTeb9
o Central banks – tightening actions/rhetoric expected from three of the four major
central banks before the end of the year: EBC 10/26 (media reports suggest the
LSAP will be extended by 9 months w/the purchase pace tapered down from EU60B
to ~EU30B), BOE 11/2 (market expects a hike), and FOMC 12/13 (market expects a
hike).
*  Global central bankers and fin mins watch Fed chair process very closely – the identity of
the next Fed chair was as key topic of conversation at the weekend IMF/World Bank
meetings in Washington according to the WSJ (http://on.wsj.com/2gbzPor).
o Why will be the next Fed chair? All the media reports suggest the race is still
between Warsh and Powell (with the former person having a small edge) although
John Taylor’s name is being mentioned more (Thy God Emperor Trump interviewed Taylor at the
White House on Wed according to multiple media reports); of all the chair
candidates (Warsh, Powell, Yellen, Cohn, and Taylor), Taylor would likely cause the
most market disruption (at least initially). Larry Kudlow spoke on CNBC Fri
afternoon (after the market close) and said Thy God Emperor Trump’s decision could wind up being
a Warsh/Taylor combination (chair/vice chair).
*  Budget resolution vote coming up in the Senate (likely Thurs 10/19) - Larry Kudlow on
CNBC (at 4:40pmET Fri afternoon) reiterated that 50 GOP votes don't exist right now for
the budget resolution in the Senate (the vote is tentatively scheduled for Thurs
10/19). Republican Sen. Thad Cochran's health issues (which could keep him from
Washington) will complicate things for Republicans (Cochran was discussed in Politico Fri
morning http://politi.co/2i8Plpu).
o Sen. Collins said she would likely vote “yes” on the budget resolution this week
(passing the budget resolution is a necessary, but rather minor, step in the tax
process) – Reuters http://reut.rs/2wWzOvv
*  Taxes – passing a budget resolution is the easy part
o Republicans are still struggling to reach a consensus around the most controversial
pieces of the 9/27 blueprint. This week’s budget resolution vote is a necessary but
rather easy part of the tax process. The harder parts of the tax debate are still
waiting awaiting resolution – rates, brackets, income thresholds, deduction
changes, deficit tolerance, etc. BAT and SALT were supposed to be the key
incremental sources of revenue to pay for reduced rates but one is already scrapped
(BAT) and the other (SALT) is facing enormous resistance. Some media reports
suggest Republicans may reach a SALT compromise (whereby individuals with
annual incomes of ~$400K+ will lose the ability to deduct SALT) but this doesn’t
raise a whole lot of revenue. Even with reasonable dynamic scoring, it gets very
difficult to lower rates meaningfully without any incremental revenue.
o Tax – what will pass and when? Investors still think “something” can happen but
that something will likely be much less ambitious than the 9/27 GOP blueprint
(corporate rate to ~25-30% w/some lower/middle-income individual relief). Nearly
no one expects tax action in 2017.
o Tax – what is priced into stocks? This question is being asked w/increased
frequency but providing a precise answer is difficult. Roughly speaking, the St is
penciling in ~$138-143 in tax-free 2018 SPX EPS w/a tax bill adding ~$5-15. At the
middle of the tax-free range (i.e. $140) the SPX PE is ~18.2x – assuming investors
would try and keep the PE around ~17.5x that would imply a 2018 EPS expectation
of ~$145 which suggests stocks are assuming some benefit from tax (albeit a
relatively small one).
*  Thy God Emperor Trump risks overloading Congress – Thy God Emperor Trump has thrown several contentious issues in the lap
of Congress just as Senate and House Republicans undertake the most dramatic overhaul of
the tax code since ’86. Between immigration/DACA, the Iran nuclear pact, and
healthcare/ACA, Congress will be forced to act over the coming months while also juggling
the tax debate. WSJ http://on.wsj.com/2wUhTFF

odds of NAFTA’s demise (at the least the demands make it unlikely an agreement on NAFTA
changes will be reached by the end of the year) – Reuters http://reut.rs/2zaxZM4

Calendar of events for the Week of Mon Oct 16
*  Calendar of events for the week of Mon 10/16 – the main focus this week will be on

country will be publishing a lot of eco data (inflation out Mon morning 10/16 and Q3 GDP
along w/Sept retail sales/IP/FAI out Thurs morning 10/19). Investors will keep an eye on
North Korea as media reports suggest the country could fire off some missiles around the
China Congress. In the US investors will be digesting earnings (the week of 10/16 is the first
busy one of the CQ3 season) and macro news should be limited aside from some Fed
speakers (including Yellen who speaks Fri 10/20 after the close). The US tax process will
continue w/the Senate voting on a budget resolution (likely Thurs 10/19) - passage is
expected but the final vote will likely be close; Rand Paul seems a hard “no” while McCain
and a few others are question marks; investors will be watching to see if any Democrats
cross the aisle. Keep in mind that the Senate budget resolution will need to be reconciled
w/the one from the House. Finally, the EU Leaders Summit runs 10/19-20 and the Japanese
snap election takes place Sun 10/22.

#Trading Update

*  What’s happening this morning? There were a bunch of headlines but the broader US
narrative isn’t changing dramatically (US S&P futures are flat-to-up 1 point). The main eco
highlight this morning was the China Sept inflation numbers (CPI was inline while PPI
firmed by more than expected). Recall it was the China Aug inflation numbers back on 9/11
that kicked off the recent reflation trade. Central bank messaging was very mixed over the
weekend as a slew of officials spoke on the sidelines of the IMF/World Bank meetings; the
coming meetings are likely to bring tightening rhetoric/actions (ECB tapering guidance
10/26, BOE hike 11/2, FOMC hike 12/13) but officials remain concerned about the state of
global inflation (and Draghi emphasized on more than one occasion how ECB ZIRP would
likely stay in place for some time after the end of the LSAP). A Bloomberg article this
morning talks about how the ECB may run out of QE capacity soon (the limit may be EU2.5T
but the ECB will have bought EU2.3T by the end of this year). On the political front, US Sen.
Susan Collins said she would likely vote “yes” on this week’s budget resolution (passage is
necessary for tax but this is a relatively minor step in the overall process), the Catalonia
situation remains unresolved as the region failed to clarify whether it intended to declare
independence (it faces a new deadline this Thurs morning), tensions flared in Iraq as gov’t
forces moved to recapture Kurdish-held oil fields and a military base near Kirkuk (this news
has oil up ~1% this morning), and polls in Japan point to a strong victory for Abe’s coalition
(the election is Sun 10/22). Stocks in Asia generally did well – TPX +0.62%, NKY +0.47%,
Hang Seng +0.76%, HSCEI +0.72%, SHCOMP -0.36%, Taiwan +0.47%, Korea +0.26%,
Australia +0.56%, and India up ~60bp. Tech stocks in Korea continued to bleed lower
(Hynix -2.2%, Samsung Electronics -0.15%) while they generally saw gains in Taiwan (Largan
+4.05%, Hon Hai +1.4%, Quanta +7%, TSMC +0.21%, etc.). Europe’s major indices are flatto-
up small; basic resources are the big upside standout (SXPP +1.6% - it was bolstered Fri
on the China import numbers and the PPI figure out of the country is helping this morning)
while chemicals, media, healthcare, and energy are all doing well too; industrials, staples,
tech, and utilities are small laggards. Convatec Group PLC is down ~20% after issuing a
profit warning and Kuehne + Nagel is weak on earnings.
o Tactically fade reflation as narrative begins fraying at the margin; 2-10 TSY spread
just a few BPs from hitting 52w tights – the reflation narrative has enjoyed several
weeks of uninterruptedly favorable news, including firming inflation, solid real
growth, expansionary fiscal policy announcements, and hawkish CB
rhetoric/decisions. However, the news is beginning to turn more neutral at the
margin and this could cause pro-reflation themes to consolidate (at least).
*  Calendar of events for the week of Mon 10/16 – the main focus this week will be on
earnings, China, and US taxes. The China National Congress kicks off Wed 10/18 and the
country will be publishing a lot of eco data (inflation out Mon morning 10/16 and Q3 GDP
along w/Sept retail sales/IP/FAI out Thurs morning 10/19). Investors will keep an eye on
North Korea as media reports suggest the country could fire off some missiles around the
China Congress. In the US investors will be digesting earnings (the week of 10/16 is the first
busy one of the CQ3 season) and macro news should be limited aside from some Fed
speakers (including Yellen who speaks Fri 10/20 after the close). The US tax process will
continue w/the Senate voting on a budget resolution (likely Thurs 10/19) - passage is
expected but the final vote will likely be close; Rand Paul seems a hard “no” while McCain
and a few others are question marks; investors will be watching to see if any Democrats
cross the aisle. Keep in mind that the Senate budget resolution will need to be reconciled
w/the one from the House. Finally, the EU Leaders Summit runs 10/19-20 and the Japanese
snap election takes place Sun 10/22.
*  Calendar for Mon 10/16 – the focus will be on earnings (SCHW pre-open and BRO, CE, IEX,
NAVI, NFLX, Rio Tinto, RT, and SONC after the close).

#Top Headlines for Monday

*  Economic data/monetary policy recap for Mon 10/16 – the main highlight this morning
were China inflation numbers and the figures were generally solid (http://bit.ly/2yk55wf).
CPI for Sept was largely inline (+1.6%) while PPI firmed by more than anticipated (+6.9% vs.
JPM +6.3% and vs. the St +6.4%).
o Central bank leadership uncertainty – Reuters discusses how the world’s major
central banks may all see leadership changes over the next 1-2 years. The Fed,
BOJ, and PBOC may all have new leaders in early ’18 while Draghi is due to depart
the scene the following year. Reuters http://reut.rs/2yqVWkJ
o Central bankers adopt dovish tone regarding policy at weekend IMF/World Bank
meetings given tepid inflation trends – “central bankers cling to stimulus amid
weak inflation” – WSJ http://on.wsj.com/2gIt6TW
o Rosengren said in an interview Friday that a Fed rate hike in Dec remained likely.
“A failure to tighten would risk both the labor market and financial prices getting
into an area where we would have to react more quickly, and that would increase
the probability that we end up having a recession” (WSJ
http://on.wsj.com/2ieTh88); Rosengren added that he anticipates 3-4 hikes next
year (Reuters http://reut.rs/2xIze41).
o ECB running out of QE capacity – total ECB bond purchases will hit EU2.28T by the
end of ’17 and some within the central bank think the ultimate limit is only EU2.5T
(meaning it may only be able to purchase an additional ~EU200B worth of bonds in
2018) – Bloomberg. https://bloom.bg/2xIiBFP
o China’s central bank governor said growth in the country could accelerate slightly
to +7% in H2 – Reuters http://bit.ly/2xIsRTa
*  US taxes – while Republican deficit hawks aren’t nearly as assertive as they once were,
disagreements over the fiscal implications of the GOP’s tax plan risk imploding the entire
initiative. Politico http://politi.co/2idPsjK
*  US taxes – mortgage interest deduction to stay but become worthless? The GOP blueprint
would double the standard deduction for individuals and couples, making the mortgage
interest deduction worthless for anyone who doesn’t itemize. WSJ
http://on.wsj.com/2ieCnGC
*  Thy God Emperor Trump privately predicts he will appoint four Supreme Court justices by the end of his first
term – Axios http://bit.ly/2yr549d
*  Spain – Catalonia’s leader failed to clarify by a Mon morning deadline whether he declared
the region independent. Spain has warned that anything but an unequivocal statement
would be taken as a declaration of secession and invite reprisal from Madrid. Catalonia
now has until Thurs morning to provide additional clarity. WSJ.
http://on.wsj.com/2gdue15
*  Iraq tensions escalate - Iraqi forces moved to recapture Kurdish-held oil fields and a military
base near the city of Kirkuk; the Iraqi gov’t was looking to recapture terrain it held prior to
2014 (when it abandoned the territory in the face of an ISIS assault) – Washington Post.
http://wapo.st/2zc0aKL
*  Japan – Abe’s ruling coalition is on track for a big win in the upcoming election (the election
takes place Sun 10/22) – Reuters http://reut.rs/2ynu7Io

to protect their access to the EU once the UK departs in 2019 – Bloomberg
https://bloom.bg/2xK2xZ6

agreement won’t call for immediate asset sales (the companies want to engage
w/regulators rather than volunteer asset sales) – Reuters http://reut.rs/2hJizrc
*  CHTR, VIA’b – the companies agreed to a short-term carriage extension so as to avoid an
immediate blackout of Viacom channels on CHTR’s systems – Reuters
http://nyti.ms/2yr561e
*  FB is looking to hire people w/national security clearance as it looks to battle against
foreign operators looking to exploit its social network – Bloomberg
*  GE – the WSJ thinks GE should be aggressive in resetting expectations and capitalized on
neg. investor sentiment; by frontloading the bad news now, GE could dramatically reset the
bar and begin delivering upside surprises for investors down the road – WSJ.
http://on.wsj.com/2zcVUuD
*  GE – the FT speculates on a dividend cut at GE – “GE is failing to cover its dividend
payments from its core operating cash flows, a position that is ultimately unsustainable”; GE
reports earnings Fri 10/20 and will update investors on 11/13; if the 11/13 restructuring
plan isn’t aggressive enough, GE’s new mgmt. team could face pressure to break the
company apart – FT http://on.ft.com/2kStpzO
*  Bombardier – the co is seeking investors for its aerospace businesses and is considering the
sale of some operations; Airbus could buy certain assets from Bombardier – Bloomberg.
https://bloom.bg/2gedsPc
*  ARMK will buy two private companies (Avendra and AmeriPride) for a combined $2.35B.
WSJ. http://on.wsj.com/2ylUDUY
*  Brooklyn Nets – Mikhail Prokhorov is seeking a valuation of ~$2B for the team as he pursues
a sale – NY Post. http://nyp.st/2wXryeB
Top Headlines from the Weekend
*  Sentiment – the cover article in this week’s Barron’s, entitled “Echoes of the 1987 Crash”
(http://bit.ly/2gjdXeu), can hardly be accused of optimism (it focuses on the market’s
structural changes and the rise of technology, including quant-based strategies and ETFs,
and how this could sow the seeds for an ’87-like crash) but its sentiments aren’t necessarily
unique either. The recent Economist title (from 10/7) lamented elevated asset valuations
(“The bull market in everything” http://econ.st/2xVXOjv) and warned of what will happen
once central banks begin withdrawing liquidity. BLK’s Larry Fink on Friday warned that risks
in the financial system at present are comparable to 2007 levels (http://reut.rs/2zmk5ax).
o Investors are right to be nervous but not necessarily because of technology or
central banks. Rather, the fact the economy is late-cycle with valuations near peak
levels is the main source of risk when it comes to equities. However, late-cycle
doesn’t mean end-cycle (as discussed in this JPMorgan note http://bit.ly/2wTZRCK)
and the absence of gross imbalances suggests a downturn isn’t imminent while
multiples can easily expand a few additional turns (and each turn means ~140 SPX
points given current earnings estimates while tax may add ~$7-10+ to EPS).
o Flow vs. stock – central bank liquidity. The Wall St narrative when it comes to
central banks and LSAPs tends to emphasize the “flow” piece of the equation (i.e.
the actual buying of assets) but it is in fact the ownership of assets (“stock”) that
acts as the mechanism for accommodation. Therefore rather than focus on central
bank buying to gauge the appropriation of liquidity it is more critical to assess
balance sheet size and on that basis central banks don’t appear on the cusp of an
acute liquidity withdrawal (as discussed in this JPMorgan note – G4 CB balance
sheets will be little changed over the next 3-4 years http://bit.ly/2xAACJL).
*  Yellen delivered comments Sun 10/15 in conjunction w/the IMF/World Bank meetings in
Washington. Overall her speech echoed many of the same sentiments she’s expressed in
recent communications and the a rate hike on 12/13 still seems likely. “Economic activity
in the United States has been growing moderately so far this year, and the labor market has
continued to strengthen”. Yellen says the recent storms will likely depress economic activity
but only temporarily (she thinks jobs growth will rebound from the depressed -33K pace of
Sept). “Wage indicators have been mixed, and the most recent news, on average hourly
earnings through September, was encouraging”. Yellen thinks inflation will firm from the
current soft trend (“my best guess is that these soft readings will not persist, and with the
ongoing strengthening of labor markets, I expect inflation to move higher next year”)
although she does acknowledge that something more structural may be occurring (“the
fact that a number of other advanced economies are also experiencing persistently low
inflation understandably adds to the sense among many analysts that something more
structural may be going on…. we will be paying close attention to the inflation data in the
months ahead”). http://bit.ly/2ykNjZM
o Kuroda spoke over the weekend in Washington and said the BOJ would continue
pursuing an aggressive monetary easing policy. “Achieving the 2% target is still a
long way off”. WSJ. http://on.wsj.com/2kPwAZ3
o Draghi spoke positively about Eurozone growth but he reiterated a cautious view
on inflation; Draghi said underlying inflation remains too weak and as a result the
ECB would need to continue providing large degrees of monetary accomodation.
WSJ http://on.wsj.com/2yLTeb9
o Central banks – tightening actions/rhetoric expected from three of the four major
central banks before the end of the year: EBC 10/26 (media reports suggest the
LSAP will be extended by 9 months w/the purchase pace tapered down from EU60B
to ~EU30B), BOE 11/2 (market expects a hike), and FOMC 12/13 (market expects a
hike).
*  Global central bankers and fin mins watch Fed chair process very closely – the identity of
the next Fed chair was as key topic of conversation at the weekend IMF/World Bank
meetings in Washington according to the WSJ (http://on.wsj.com/2gbzPor).
o Why will be the next Fed chair? All the media reports suggest the race is still
between Warsh and Powell (with the former person having a small edge) although
John Taylor’s name is being mentioned more (Thy God Emperor Trump interviewed Taylor at the
White House on Wed according to multiple media reports); of all the chair
candidates (Warsh, Powell, Yellen, Cohn, and Taylor), Taylor would likely cause the
most market disruption (at least initially). Larry Kudlow spoke on CNBC Fri
afternoon (after the market close) and said Thy God Emperor Trump’s decision could wind up being
a Warsh/Taylor combination (chair/vice chair).
*  Budget resolution vote coming up in the Senate (likely Thurs 10/19) - Larry Kudlow on
CNBC (at 4:40pmET Fri afternoon) reiterated that 50 GOP votes don't exist right now for
the budget resolution in the Senate (the vote is tentatively scheduled for Thurs
10/19). Republican Sen. Thad Cochran's health issues (which could keep him from
Washington) will complicate things for Republicans (Cochran was discussed in Politico Fri
morning http://politi.co/2i8Plpu).
o Sen. Collins said she would likely vote “yes” on the budget resolution this week
(passing the budget resolution is a necessary, but rather minor, step in the tax
process) – Reuters http://reut.rs/2wWzOvv
*  Taxes – passing a budget resolution is the easy part
o Republicans are still struggling to reach a consensus around the most controversial
pieces of the 9/27 blueprint. This week’s budget resolution vote is a necessary but
rather easy part of the tax process. The harder parts of the tax debate are still
waiting awaiting resolution – rates, brackets, income thresholds, deduction
changes, deficit tolerance, etc. BAT and SALT were supposed to be the key
incremental sources of revenue to pay for reduced rates but one is already scrapped
(BAT) and the other (SALT) is facing enormous resistance. Some media reports
suggest Republicans may reach a SALT compromise (whereby individuals with
annual incomes of ~$400K+ will lose the ability to deduct SALT) but this doesn’t
raise a whole lot of revenue. Even with reasonable dynamic scoring, it gets very
difficult to lower rates meaningfully without any incremental revenue.
o Tax – what will pass and when? Investors still think “something” can happen but
that something will likely be much less ambitious than the 9/27 GOP blueprint
(corporate rate to ~25-30% w/some lower/middle-income individual relief). Nearly
no one expects tax action in 2017.
o Tax – what is priced into stocks? This question is being asked w/increased
frequency but providing a precise answer is difficult. Roughly speaking, the St is
penciling in ~$138-143 in tax-free 2018 SPX EPS w/a tax bill adding ~$5-15. At the
middle of the tax-free range (i.e. $140) the SPX PE is ~18.2x – assuming investors
would try and keep the PE around ~17.5x that would imply a 2018 EPS expectation
of ~$145 which suggests stocks are assuming some benefit from tax (albeit a
relatively small one).
*  Thy God Emperor Trump risks overloading Congress – Thy God Emperor Trump has thrown several contentious issues in the lap
of Congress just as Senate and House Republicans undertake the most dramatic overhaul of
the tax code since ’86. Between immigration/DACA, the Iran nuclear pact, and
healthcare/ACA, Congress will be forced to act over the coming months while also juggling
the tax debate. WSJ http://on.wsj.com/2wUhTFF
o Thy God Emperor Trump’s move to end ACA exchange subsidies raises the risk of a gov’t shutdown
on 12/8; Democrats may demand the funds be authorized legislatively or threaten a
shutdown – Washington Post. http://wapo.st/2z7C7MT
*  Thy God Emperor Trump backs Bannon on pledge to primary insubordinate Republicans – Thy God Emperor Trump called
Bannon and offered words of encouragement to the former strategist over his pledge to
oppose any Republican not actively backing the president’s agenda – WSJ
http://on.wsj.com/2wUhTFF

*  Thy God Emperor Trump vs. Corker feud continues – Sen. Corker spoke to the Washington Post on Friday and

Politico http://politi.co/2ggN3nJ
o Drug price battle shifts from Washington to the states – pharma companies are
fighting a host of drug price-control measures being adopted by states across the
US. FT http://on.ft.com/2yLrcwp
*  NAFTA talks aren’t going well – demands made by the US last week have increased the
odds of NAFTA’s demise (at the least the demands make it unlikely an agreement on NAFTA
changes will be reached by the end of the year) – Reuters http://reut.rs/2zaxZM4
o NAFTA demise emerging as a new risk for investors – the risk of NAFTA collapsing is
rising and this is something investors are beginning to consider. WSJ
http://on.wsj.com/2yniIs8
*  China economic growth – China’s money supply statistics were released over the weekend
and they came in strong. M2 money supply rose 9.2% in Sept (vs. the St +8.9%) while new
yuan loans came in at CNY1.27T (vs. the St CNY1.2T); see JPMorgan’s takeaways here:
http://bit.ly/2wXModQ. The head of China’s central bank spoke over the weekend and said
economic indicators show “stabilized and stronger growth” (https://bloom.bg/2xHjYJy).
*  German coalition gov’t unlikely to form until 2018 – Reuters http://reut.rs/2yJ2JYo

*  Austria – Sebastian Kurz looks set to become the next chancellor of Austria although his
People’s Party (OVP) failed to win an outright majority (it secured 57 out of 183 seats). The
OVP is widely expected to form a coalition with the Freedom Party (FPO) which secured 51
seats. CNN. http://cnn.it/2ykzIlo

#Trading Update

* What’s happening this morning? It was another slow evening of news other than the
German Aug factory order numbers (which were very strong although the euro and
Eurozone stocks are both in the red), a few US earnings reports (COST and YUMC), andsome M&A (GIMO, HON, JWN, PENN/PNK, SNCR, and more). The overall macro narrativeremains the same as it was at the Thurs close (see below for an update on the macro narrative as well as potential upcoming risks). The major Asian indices generally saw gains –
TPX +0.28%, NKY +0.3%, Hang Seng +0.28%, HSCEI +0.54%, Taiwan +0.14%, Australia
+1.04%, and India +0.5-7% (mainland China and Korea were both closed). There weren’t
any huge themes in Asia although Macau casino stocks were weak in HK on back of
underwhelming Golden Week visitor numbers (autos and financials led HK on the upside).
Australia’s 1% rally was led by banks, miners, and telecoms. The major Eurozone indices
are trading off small (~10-20bp); autos are outperforming while banks, retail, energy, and
utilities lag. The GBP is extending its losses from Thurs amid more uncertainty around UK
PM May (the DXY spiked ~50bp Thurs and is up small so far Fri morning). US S&P futures
are trading down 1-2 points.
* Calendar for Fri 10/6 – the focus will be on the US jobs report for Sept (8:30amET), US
wholesale inventories/trade sales for Aug (10amET), US consumer credit for Aug (3pmET),
and Fed speakers (Kaplan 8:30amET on CNBC, Bostic 9:15amET, Dudley 12:15pmET, Kaplan
12:45pmET, and Bullard 1pmET).
o US jobs preview – there is very little anticipation or focus on the Sept jobs report
(Fri morning 8/6 8:30amET) as 1) most are anticipating large storm-related
distortions and 2) at this point in the cycle it only requires ~75K monthly adds to
keep the UR steady (as was discussed in this JPMorgan report http://bit.ly/2fbT6cE).
The St is in print at +80K for adds (vs. ADP for Sept at +135K and Aug BLS +156K)
w/a 4.4% UR (unchanged w/Aug) and wages +0.3% M/M and +2.5% Y/Y (vs. Aug
+0.1% M/M and +2.5% Y/Y). It’s very difficult to see the Sept BLS report changing
the near-term US monetary policy trajectory (w/ongoing normalization and a FF
hike on 12/13). The potential for a hike on 11/1 is very low and if anything the
Sept CPI on Fri 10/13 may be a more important data point than jobs on Fri 10/6.
Instead, the bigger Fed uncertainty has nothing to do w/data or policy but instead
concerns staffing (i.e. who will be the next chair? A Trump announcement could
come as soon as next week – Powell and Warsh are the frontrunners according to
media reports w/the former appearing to have a slight edge).

#Top Headlines for Friday

* Eco data recap for Fri morning 10/6 – the big data came out of Germany where factory
orders for Aug beat expectations by a wide margin (orders +3.6% M/M vs. the St +0.7% and
+7.8% Y/Y vs. the St +4.7%). See JPMorgan’s comments on the German data
(http://bit.ly/2y42sh4). Japan’s wage inflation figures for Aug were soft, as expected
(http://bit.ly/2kuygr0).
o Fed chair – markets would be comfortable w/any of the main candidates (including
Powell, Warsh, Cohn, Yellen, etc.) w/the exception of one person: John Taylor.
Bloomberg.
o Fed update – Kansas City Fed President George spoke Thurs night and said the US
economy needed further rates hikes (http://cnb.cx/2kqTiqj). JPMorgan’s Mike
Feroli published an updated FOMC hawk/dove chart following the confirmation of
Quarles (http://bit.ly/2z1jSti).
o Japan’s “Party of Hope” unveils an economic agenda that pledges to rely less on
aggressive fiscal and monetary stimulus – Reuters http://reut.rs/2ghahXu
o AUD hit as RBA’s Harper doesn’t rule out a rate cut in a WSJ article.
http://on.wsj.com/2xW3nkD
* UK PM May the subject of more speculation amid disclosure of plot to topple her; former
party chairman, Grant Shapps, said May’s leadership should now be challenged. Reuters
http://reut.rs/2yMrmzB
* Spain/Catalonia – Spain’s Constitutional Court ordered the suspension of the Catalan
parliament’s regional session scheduled for Mon; Catalonia had planned on declaring
independence at the session. Reuters http://reut.rs/2xlDfjC
o Spain’s gov’t will change rules and make it easier for firms to move their legal base
out of Catalonia – Reuters http://reut.rs/2z1WQCF
* Tax update - there is a lot of focus on taxes in the US as the Senate Budget Committee
(right at the Thurs close) and the full House (at ~1pmET Thurs afternoon) advance budget
resolutions (the full Senate will presumably vote within the next two weeks). This is a
necessary step in the tax process (as these resolutions contain the reconciliation
instructions allowing tax to pass via a simple majority in the Senate) but also a relatively minor one. Far more complicated will be agreeing on rates, deduction schedules, deficits,
etc., and if anything all the press in the last few days and weeks point to divisions within
the GOP on these matters being larger than anticipated.
o Schumer warns that the proposal to eliminate the SALT deduction will kill the GOP
tax plan – Bloomberg. https://bloom.bg/2xXX8KL
o GOP desire to repeal the estate tax runs into resistance - from Republicans. As a
result this piece of the 9/27 tax blueprint (among others) may wind up being
scrapped - WSJ. http://on.wsj.com/2gf9G8E
o Fed officials express concern over tax plans – Fed officials warned the tax plan may
only provide a temporary boost to growth while fueling inflation and driving debt to
unsustainable levels – Reuters http://reut.rs/2xWMrdG
* Republican headaches keep growing as donors withhold money, a tax consensus fails to
materialize, and “establishment” figures depart the scene (Strange losing to Moore, Corker
retiring, etc.). Republican leaders are increasingly concerned about the party’s grip on the
House and Senate should it fail to pass a tax bill. Leaders “fear that the inchoate populism
that Mr. Trump personifies, and which Mr. Bannon is attempting to weaponize against
incumbents, is on the march” – NYT http://nyti.ms/2y3lUKT
* Trump looks to jolt NAFTA – the White House is considering a proposal that would
represent a radical shift to the principles underlying NAFTA. According to rule changes
being considered, automobiles would need to have a specific level of US-made content in
order to qualify for tariff breaks (right now autos only need to have a specific level of
content from within the NAFTA region). WSJ. http://on.wsj.com/2y4LXlo
* Trump makes cryptic comment ahead of a dinner with US military leaders. Trump said the
dinner might represent “the calm before the storm”. Asked repeatedly by reporters to
clarify his comments, Trump said, “You’ll find out” – Bloomberg https://bloom.bg/2xXI2r6
* Trump was “furious” over NBC’s Tillerson “moron” article; John Kelly was forced to
rearrange his schedule and stayed in Washington in order to try and calm tensions – NBC.
http://nbcnews.to/2fOGx3B
* Iran/Trump – Trump will “decertify” the Iran nuclear accord next week (speech on 10/12)
and declare the agreement as not being in the US national interest according to the
Washington Post (article out at ~2:40pmET Thurs afternoon). This is consistent w/what the
AP and Politico reported earlier in the week. Note that Trump’s 10/12 declarations won’t
end the Iranian nuclear pact as it will be up to Congress whether re-impose sanctions on
Tehran (and Trump will hold off on recommending such a step). Washington Post
http://wapo.st/2z1zeOw
o Decertifying the Iran Deal Wouldn’t Have to Kill It – WSJ
http://on.wsj.com/2y40dKY
* North Korea – US lawmakers are pressuring the Trump White House to toughen sanctions
against North Korea – WSJ. http://on.wsj.com/2xlKdVQ
* The Economist's lead article this week speaks to sentiment at the moment and this is one of
the big reasons why stocks are proving to be so resilient. ""Asset prices are high across the
board. Is it time to worry?"" (http://econ.st/2xVXOjv).
o The WSJ notes that a key European junk-bond index is now yielding less than 10yr
US TSYs although it offers a reasonable explanation for this ostensibly irrational
price level – WSJ. http://on.wsj.com/2xkwYVb
* Company-specific news update from Thurs night. There were a few earnings reports out
Thurs AMC but for the most part it was another slow evening. COST EPS beats thanks to
better SG&A and favorable tax while GMs were light; Sept same-store-sales beat w/upside
in the US (the stock ended down 3% during the Thurs after-hours trading session). YUMC’s
results came in ahead of expectations (EPS/same-store-sales) and it increased capital return.
SNCR reentered M&A talks w/Siris Capital (Siris is looking to buy SNCR’s Intralinks and may
take a ~20% equity stake in SNCR); SNCR ended up ~27% during the Thurs after-hours
trading session. According to the WSJ, HON is pursuing an acquisition of Evoqua Water Tech
in a deal that could be worth $3B (http://on.wsj.com/2yseCSp). The WSJ reported (during
trading on Thurs http://on.wsj.com/2xjE24p) on merger talks between PENN and PNK (the
firms have been unable to agree to terms but PENN is still interested in buying PNK).
* JWN buyout not completely dead – the Nordstrom family is exploring a new deal structure
w/Leonard Green that would involve less debt. The family is trying to raise more equity
(although it isn’t clear where the money will come from). WSJ. http://on.wsj.com/2ggTvbh
* GIMO – Elliot’s takeover talks w/the company have ground to a halt according to Reuters
over price disagreements – Reuters http://reut.rs/2fNCepo
* SUM, ASHG – SUM has made a rival bid for ASHG as it looks to scuttle the existing Ash
Grove-CRH PLC transaction. Ash Grove’s board said the offer could result in a superior
proposal and that it would engage in talks with the third party. Bloomberg.
* AMZN: the one market where Amazon is failing to dominate: Hollywood. The WSJ
discusses AMZN’s failure to become a force in content. WSJ. http://on.wsj.com/2xZcJtr
* Macau casino stocks slump during Fri trading as Golden Week visitor numbers disappoint
expectations – Bloomberg https://bloom.bg/2fOuGmd

#Identifying risks – what could go wrong?

* Reflation enthusiasm is undercut by less aggressive CB normalization, dramatic curve
flattening, and/or a softening in nominal growth. Of all the reflation pieces (monetary policy
normalization, expansionary fiscal policy, firming inflation, and ongoing real growth
strength), the last piece (real growth) is increasingly being taken for granted.
* Bank investors wind up focusing too much on reflation/yields (which are tailwinds) but miss
weakening credit (higher provisions) and tepid loan growth.
* The first speech by the next Fed chair unsettles sentiment (assuming the chair isn’t Yellen).
* The tax process slows in Washington as Republicans prove incapable of reaching a
consensus on rates, deductions, and deficits.
* Paul Ryan decides to “pull a Boehner”, stepping down as Speaker out of frustration with his
inability to pass legislation.
* The final tax bill results in materially higher rates for upper-income Americans.
* May winds up stepping down as UK PM, sowing ongoing Brexit uncertainty.
* Abe does much worse than anticipated during the upcoming Japan election (10/22).
* North Korea conducts an above-ground nuclear bomb test (or even worse, an atmospheric
test).
* Iran decides to resume its nuclear weapons program, sparking an immediate escalation of
Middle East geopolitical tensions (Trump’s Iran speech is coming up on 10/12).
* Washington introduces (or threatens to introduce) tough new regulations aimed at
internet/social media companies following the Russia election investigations (note that US
internet giants will be testifying before Congress on 11/1).
* Prominent members of the Trump team decide to leave the gov’t (the market would be
particularly sensitive to Tillerson, Mattis, Kelly, and/or Cohn departing; recent media reports
suggest the Tillerson-Trump relationship is particularly strained).

#Macro Update

* The pro-reflation bias commenced back on 9/11 and has been propelled ever since by
ongoing real growth strength, firming inflation, normalizing monetary policy/rhetoric, and
expansionary fiscal policy (in particular in the US w/the 9/27 tax blueprint but also in
Germany following that country’s election outcome and fin min change).
* This enthusiasm can extend for a few more weeks but the ECB/BOE decisions (on 10/26
and 11/2, respectively) will mark the culmination of a series of pro-reflation
catalysts/developments and thus the trade may enter a period of extended consolidation
around those central bank events.
* Meanwhile the nuances of this present reflation process aren’t being appreciated –
growth and corporate earnings are late-cycle (not early), multiples are already rich
(although not necessarily ridiculous), inflation is only very gradually firming to target, the
economy faces enormous structural headwinds in the form of labor supply and productivity
growth, and while central banks are normalizing policy will stay extremely accommodative
for years to come (the structural headwinds and slow tightening pace will prevent yields
from materially rising and curves from significantly steepening).
* The tenor of sentiment is beginning to evolve and there is definitely greater frustration
w/people being forced to participate in a tape many don’t particularly love at present
levels – this helps fuel runs such has occurred over the last few weeks (the SPX hasn’t closed
in the red since Mon 9/25) but it also makes for a precarious setup w/a lot of weak
“renters” who will be quick to sell the minute momentum pauses.
* Bottom Line: the lack of major catalysts is helping the rally propagate and the calendar is
relatively clear until earnings (which kick off w/banks on Thurs 10/12). The reflation
impetus will likely stay in place into the ECB/BOE (10/26 and 11/2, respectively) after which
a consolidation (at least) is likely (note that a lot of the “easy” tax steps are occurring now
– the blueprint on 9/27, the budget resolutions, etc. However, reaching a consensus on
rates, deductions, and deficits will be extremely difficult and this will become more
apparent later in Oct and into Nov, around the same time as the ECB/BOE decisions).

#Calendar of events to watch for the week of Mon Oct 9

* Calendar for the week of 10/9 – overall it should be a relatively slow week although a few
items are in focus. The current reflation emphasis makes the US CPI on Fri 10/13 prob. the
single most important eco data point of the week but there are other numbers in focus
(German trade/IP for Aug and China imports/exports for Sept). The CQ3 earnings season
kicks off in earnest with the banks on Thurs and Friday. Away from scheduled events, media
reports suggest Catalonia could formally declare independence on Mon (although this could
easily be delayed following court challenges and as the region’s leaders seek a settlement
w/Madrid) while the White House may unveil its infrastructure spending blueprint during
the week of 10/9 (http://bit.ly/2wwiop9). South Korean security officials have warned that
North Korea may fire additional missiles between 10/10 and 10/18 while Trump’s Fed chair
selection could come soon (media reports suggest Powell and Warsh are the two
frontrunners). Trump is expected to deliver an Iranian policy speech on/around Thurs
10/12 during which he will declare the nuclear deal as no longer being in the US national
interest. HON has said it will announce its formal portfolio review decision prior to earnings
(media reports, including on CNBC, suggest it will retain its aerospace unit).
* Calendar for Mon 10/9 – the day should be pretty quiet owing to the US Columbus Day
holiday (equities will be open but fixed income is closed). The focus will be on the China FX
reserve numbers for Sept (Fri night/Sat morning 10/7), the China Caixin services PMI for
Sept (Sun night/Mon morning), Germany’s industrial production for Aug (2amET), and
earnings (LVMH reports results after the European close).
* Calendar for Tues 10/10 – the focus will be on the German trade figures for Aug (2amET), a
bunch of analyst meetings (including TECD, Santander, WDAY, and WMT), the PG
shareholder meeting (at which the Trian/Peltz board seat request will be voted on), and
earnings (CUDA after the close).
* Calendar for Wed 10/11 – the focus will be on the US JOLTs report for Aug (10amET), Fed
minutes from the 9/20 meeting (2pmET), analyst meetings (KR), and earnings (DAL, BLK,
FAST, and OZRK before the open).
 
* Calendar for Thurs 10/12 – the focus will be on Eurozone IP for Aug (5amET), the US PPI for
Sept (8:30amET), Trump’s Iran speech, analyst meetings (BOX, HPQ, LSCC, and WDC), and
earnings (C, DPZ, JPM, LNN, Sky PLC, and Tata Consultancy pre-open).
* Calendar for Fri 10/13 – the focus will be on China’s imports/exports for Sept (Thurs
night/Fri morning), the US CPI for Sept (8:30amET), US retail sales for Sept (8:30amET), the
Michigan Confidence numbers for Oct (10amET), US business inventories for Aug (10amET),
analyst meetings (SAFM), and earnings (BAC, DRFG, FHN, FRC, JBHT, Man Group, PNC, and
WFC pre-open).

#Trading Update

* What’s happening this morning? It was another slow evening of news other than the
German Aug factory order numbers (which were very strong although the euro and
Eurozone stocks are both in the red), a few US earnings reports (COST and YUMC), andsome M&A (GIMO, HON, JWN, PENN/PNK, SNCR, and more). The overall macro narrativeremains the same as it was at the Thurs close (see below for an update on the macro narrative as well as potential upcoming risks). The major Asian indices generally saw gains –
TPX +0.28%, NKY +0.3%, Hang Seng +0.28%, HSCEI +0.54%, Taiwan +0.14%, Australia
+1.04%, and India +0.5-7% (mainland China and Korea were both closed). There weren’t
any huge themes in Asia although Macau casino stocks were weak in HK on back of
underwhelming Golden Week visitor numbers (autos and financials led HK on the upside).
Australia’s 1% rally was led by banks, miners, and telecoms. The major Eurozone indices
are trading off small (~10-20bp); autos are outperforming while banks, retail, energy, and
utilities lag. The GBP is extending its losses from Thurs amid more uncertainty around UK
PM May (the DXY spiked ~50bp Thurs and is up small so far Fri morning). US S&P futures
are trading down 1-2 points.
* Calendar for Fri 10/6 – the focus will be on the US jobs report for Sept (8:30amET), US
wholesale inventories/trade sales for Aug (10amET), US consumer credit for Aug (3pmET),
and Fed speakers (Kaplan 8:30amET on CNBC, Bostic 9:15amET, Dudley 12:15pmET, Kaplan
12:45pmET, and Bullard 1pmET).
o US jobs preview – there is very little anticipation or focus on the Sept jobs report
(Fri morning 8/6 8:30amET) as 1) most are anticipating large storm-related
distortions and 2) at this point in the cycle it only requires ~75K monthly adds to
keep the UR steady (as was discussed in this JPMorgan report http://bit.ly/2fbT6cE).
The St is in print at +80K for adds (vs. ADP for Sept at +135K and Aug BLS +156K)
w/a 4.4% UR (unchanged w/Aug) and wages +0.3% M/M and +2.5% Y/Y (vs. Aug
+0.1% M/M and +2.5% Y/Y). It’s very difficult to see the Sept BLS report changing
the near-term US monetary policy trajectory (w/ongoing normalization and a FF
hike on 12/13). The potential for a hike on 11/1 is very low and if anything the
Sept CPI on Fri 10/13 may be a more important data point than jobs on Fri 10/6.
Instead, the bigger Fed uncertainty has nothing to do w/data or policy but instead
concerns staffing (i.e. who will be the next chair? A Trump announcement could
come as soon as next week – Powell and Warsh are the frontrunners according to
media reports w/the former appearing to have a slight edge).

#Top Headlines for Friday

* Eco data recap for Fri morning 10/6 – the big data came out of Germany where factory
orders for Aug beat expectations by a wide margin (orders +3.6% M/M vs. the St +0.7% and
+7.8% Y/Y vs. the St +4.7%). See JPMorgan’s comments on the German data
(http://bit.ly/2y42sh4). Japan’s wage inflation figures for Aug were soft, as expected
(http://bit.ly/2kuygr0).
o Fed chair – markets would be comfortable w/any of the main candidates (including
Powell, Warsh, Cohn, Yellen, etc.) w/the exception of one person: John Taylor.
Bloomberg.
o Fed update – Kansas City Fed President George spoke Thurs night and said the US
economy needed further rates hikes (http://cnb.cx/2kqTiqj). JPMorgan’s Mike
Feroli published an updated FOMC hawk/dove chart following the confirmation of
Quarles (http://bit.ly/2z1jSti).
o Japan’s “Party of Hope” unveils an economic agenda that pledges to rely less on
aggressive fiscal and monetary stimulus – Reuters http://reut.rs/2ghahXu
o AUD hit as RBA’s Harper doesn’t rule out a rate cut in a WSJ article.
http://on.wsj.com/2xW3nkD
* UK PM May the subject of more speculation amid disclosure of plot to topple her; former
party chairman, Grant Shapps, said May’s leadership should now be challenged. Reuters
http://reut.rs/2yMrmzB
* Spain/Catalonia – Spain’s Constitutional Court ordered the suspension of the Catalan
parliament’s regional session scheduled for Mon; Catalonia had planned on declaring
independence at the session. Reuters http://reut.rs/2xlDfjC
o Spain’s gov’t will change rules and make it easier for firms to move their legal base
out of Catalonia – Reuters http://reut.rs/2z1WQCF
* Tax update - there is a lot of focus on taxes in the US as the Senate Budget Committee
(right at the Thurs close) and the full House (at ~1pmET Thurs afternoon) advance budget
resolutions (the full Senate will presumably vote within the next two weeks). This is a
necessary step in the tax process (as these resolutions contain the reconciliation
instructions allowing tax to pass via a simple majority in the Senate) but also a relatively minor one. Far more complicated will be agreeing on rates, deduction schedules, deficits,
etc., and if anything all the press in the last few days and weeks point to divisions within
the GOP on these matters being larger than anticipated.
o Schumer warns that the proposal to eliminate the SALT deduction will kill the GOP
tax plan – Bloomberg. https://bloom.bg/2xXX8KL
o GOP desire to repeal the estate tax runs into resistance - from Republicans. As a
result this piece of the 9/27 tax blueprint (among others) may wind up being
scrapped - WSJ. http://on.wsj.com/2gf9G8E
o Fed officials express concern over tax plans – Fed officials warned the tax plan may
only provide a temporary boost to growth while fueling inflation and driving debt to
unsustainable levels – Reuters http://reut.rs/2xWMrdG
* Republican headaches keep growing as donors withhold money, a tax consensus fails to
materialize, and “establishment” figures depart the scene (Strange losing to Moore, Corker
retiring, etc.). Republican leaders are increasingly concerned about the party’s grip on the
House and Senate should it fail to pass a tax bill. Leaders “fear that the inchoate populism
that Mr. Trump personifies, and which Mr. Bannon is attempting to weaponize against
incumbents, is on the march” – NYT http://nyti.ms/2y3lUKT
* Trump looks to jolt NAFTA – the White House is considering a proposal that would
represent a radical shift to the principles underlying NAFTA. According to rule changes
being considered, automobiles would need to have a specific level of US-made content in
order to qualify for tariff breaks (right now autos only need to have a specific level of
content from within the NAFTA region). WSJ. http://on.wsj.com/2y4LXlo
* Trump makes cryptic comment ahead of a dinner with US military leaders. Trump said the
dinner might represent “the calm before the storm”. Asked repeatedly by reporters to
clarify his comments, Trump said, “You’ll find out” – Bloomberg https://bloom.bg/2xXI2r6
* Trump was “furious” over NBC’s Tillerson “moron” article; John Kelly was forced to
rearrange his schedule and stayed in Washington in order to try and calm tensions – NBC.
http://nbcnews.to/2fOGx3B
* Iran/Trump – Trump will “decertify” the Iran nuclear accord next week (speech on 10/12)
and declare the agreement as not being in the US national interest according to the
Washington Post (article out at ~2:40pmET Thurs afternoon). This is consistent w/what the
AP and Politico reported earlier in the week. Note that Trump’s 10/12 declarations won’t
end the Iranian nuclear pact as it will be up to Congress whether re-impose sanctions on
Tehran (and Trump will hold off on recommending such a step). Washington Post

* The Economist's lead article this week speaks to sentiment at the moment and this is one of
the big reasons why stocks are proving to be so resilient. ""Asset prices are high across the
board. Is it time to worry?"" (http://econ.st/2xVXOjv).
o The WSJ notes that a key European junk-bond index is now yielding less than 10yr
US TSYs although it offers a reasonable explanation for this ostensibly irrational
price level – WSJ. http://on.wsj.com/2xkwYVb
* Company-specific news update from Thurs night. There were a few earnings reports out
Thurs AMC but for the most part it was another slow evening. COST EPS beats thanks to
better SG&A and favorable tax while GMs were light; Sept same-store-sales beat w/upside
in the US (the stock ended down 3% during the Thurs after-hours trading session). YUMC’s
results came in ahead of expectations (EPS/same-store-sales) and it increased capital return.
SNCR reentered M&A talks w/Siris Capital (Siris is looking to buy SNCR’s Intralinks and may
take a ~20% equity stake in SNCR); SNCR ended up ~27% during the Thurs after-hours
trading session. According to the WSJ, HON is pursuing an acquisition of Evoqua Water Tech
in a deal that could be worth $3B (http://on.wsj.com/2yseCSp). The WSJ reported (during
trading on Thurs http://on.wsj.com/2xjE24p) on merger talks between PENN and PNK (the
firms have been unable to agree to terms but PENN is still interested in buying PNK).
* JWN buyout not completely dead – the Nordstrom family is exploring a new deal structure
w/Leonard Green that would involve less debt. The family is trying to raise more equity
(although it isn’t clear where the money will come from). WSJ. http://on.wsj.com/2ggTvbh
* GIMO – Elliot’s takeover talks w/the company have ground to a halt according to Reuters
over price disagreements – Reuters http://reut.rs/2fNCepo
* SUM, ASHG – SUM has made a rival bid for ASHG as it looks to scuttle the existing Ash
Grove-CRH PLC transaction. Ash Grove’s board said the offer could result in a superior
proposal and that it would engage in talks with the third party. Bloomberg.

expectations – Bloomberg https://bloom.bg/2fOuGmd

#Identifying risks – what could go wrong?

* Reflation enthusiasm is undercut by less aggressive CB normalization, dramatic curve
flattening, and/or a softening in nominal growth. Of all the reflation pieces (monetary policy
normalization, expansionary fiscal policy, firming inflation, and ongoing real growth
strength), the last piece (real growth) is increasingly being taken for granted.
* Bank investors wind up focusing too much on reflation/yields (which are tailwinds) but miss
weakening credit (higher provisions) and tepid loan growth.
* The first speech by the next Fed chair unsettles sentiment (assuming the chair isn’t Yellen).
* The tax process slows in Washington as Republicans prove incapable of reaching a
consensus on rates, deductions, and deficits.
* Paul Ryan decides to “pull a Boehner”, stepping down as Speaker out of frustration with his
inability to pass legislation.
* The final tax bill results in materially higher rates for upper-income Americans.
* May winds up stepping down as UK PM, sowing ongoing Brexit uncertainty.
* Abe does much worse than anticipated during the upcoming Japan election (10/22).
* North Korea conducts an above-ground nuclear bomb test (or even worse, an atmospheric
test).
* Iran decides to resume its nuclear weapons program, sparking an immediate escalation of
Middle East geopolitical tensions (Trump’s Iran speech is coming up on 10/12).
* Washington introduces (or threatens to introduce) tough new regulations aimed at
internet/social media companies following the Russia election investigations (note that US
internet giants will be testifying before Congress on 11/1).
* Prominent members of the Trump team decide to leave the gov’t (the market would be
particularly sensitive to Tillerson, Mattis, Kelly, and/or Cohn departing; recent media reports
suggest the Tillerson-Trump relationship is particularly strained).

#Macro Update

* The pro-reflation bias commenced back on 9/11 and has been propelled ever since by
ongoing real growth strength, firming inflation, normalizing monetary policy/rhetoric, and
expansionary fiscal policy (in particular in the US w/the 9/27 tax blueprint but also in
Germany following that country’s election outcome and fin min change).
* This enthusiasm can extend for a few more weeks but the ECB/BOE decisions (on 10/26
and 11/2, respectively) will mark the culmination of a series of pro-reflation
catalysts/developments and thus the trade may enter a period of extended consolidation
around those central bank events.
* Meanwhile the nuances of this present reflation process aren’t being appreciated –
growth and corporate earnings are late-cycle (not early), multiples are already rich
(although not necessarily ridiculous), inflation is only very gradually firming to target, the
economy faces enormous structural headwinds in the form of labor supply and productivity
growth, and while central banks are normalizing policy will stay extremely accommodative
for years to come (the structural headwinds and slow tightening pace will prevent yields
from materially rising and curves from significantly steepening).
* The tenor of sentiment is beginning to evolve and there is definitely greater frustration
w/people being forced to participate in a tape many don’t particularly love at present
levels – this helps fuel runs such has occurred over the last few weeks (the SPX hasn’t closed
in the red since Mon 9/25) but it also makes for a precarious setup w/a lot of weak
“renters” who will be quick to sell the minute momentum pauses.
* Bottom Line: the lack of major catalysts is helping the rally propagate and the calendar is
relatively clear until earnings (which kick off w/banks on Thurs 10/12). The reflation
impetus will likely stay in place into the ECB/BOE (10/26 and 11/2, respectively) after which
a consolidation (at least) is likely (note that a lot of the “easy” tax steps are occurring now
– the blueprint on 9/27, the budget resolutions, etc. However, reaching a consensus on
rates, deductions, and deficits will be extremely difficult and this will become more
apparent later in Oct and into Nov, around the same time as the ECB/BOE decisions).

#Calendar of events to watch for the week of Mon Oct 9

* Calendar for the week of 10/9 – overall it should be a relatively slow week although a few
items are in focus. The current reflation emphasis makes the US CPI on Fri 10/13 prob. the
single most important eco data point of the week but there are other numbers in focus
(German trade/IP for Aug and China imports/exports for Sept). The CQ3 earnings season
kicks off in earnest with the banks on Thurs and Friday. Away from scheduled events, media
reports suggest Catalonia could formally declare independence on Mon (although this could
easily be delayed following court challenges and as the region’s leaders seek a settlement
w/Madrid) while the White House may unveil its infrastructure spending blueprint during
the week of 10/9 (http://bit.ly/2wwiop9). South Korean security officials have warned that
North Korea may fire additional missiles between 10/10 and 10/18 while Trump’s Fed chair
selection could come soon (media reports suggest Powell and Warsh are the two
frontrunners). Trump is expected to deliver an Iranian policy speech on/around Thurs
10/12 during which he will declare the nuclear deal as no longer being in the US national
interest. HON has said it will announce its formal portfolio review decision prior to earnings
(media reports, including on CNBC, suggest it will retain its aerospace unit).
* Calendar for Mon 10/9 – the day should be pretty quiet owing to the US Columbus Day
holiday (equities will be open but fixed income is closed). The focus will be on the China FX
reserve numbers for Sept (Fri night/Sat morning 10/7), the China Caixin services PMI for
Sept (Sun night/Mon morning), Germany’s industrial production for Aug (2amET), and
earnings (LVMH reports results after the European close).
* Calendar for Tues 10/10 – the focus will be on the German trade figures for Aug (2amET), a
bunch of analyst meetings (including TECD, Santander, WDAY, and WMT), the PG
shareholder meeting (at which the Trian/Peltz board seat request will be voted on), and
earnings (CUDA after the close).
* Calendar for Wed 10/11 – the focus will be on the US JOLTs report for Aug (10amET), Fed
minutes from the 9/20 meeting (2pmET), analyst meetings (KR), and earnings (DAL, BLK,
FAST, and OZRK before the open).
 
* Calendar for Thurs 10/12 – the focus will be on Eurozone IP for Aug (5amET), the US PPI for
Sept (8:30amET), Trump’s Iran speech, analyst meetings (BOX, HPQ, LSCC, and WDC), and
earnings (C, DPZ, JPM, LNN, Sky PLC, and Tata Consultancy pre-open).
* Calendar for Fri 10/13 – the focus will be on China’s imports/exports for Sept (Thurs
night/Fri morning), the US CPI for Sept (8:30amET), US retail sales for Sept (8:30amET), the
Michigan Confidence numbers for Oct (10amET), US business inventories for Aug (10amET),
analyst meetings (SAFM), and earnings (BAC, DRFG, FHN, FRC, JBHT, Man Group, PNC, and
WFC pre-open).

TMO,wallstreetbets,Obamacare Repeal Vote Looming...,"So with the last-ditch effort on Obamacare repeal looking like it might pass (deadline September 30), I thought I'd share some ideas for some good short-term plays leading up to the vote:

Hospitals: for-profit hospitals will get crushed if this passes, and will rally if it doesn't. THC is my favorite play here. 

Managed care providers: from what I've heard, Medicare-centric providers will get hurt the most from repeal. So look at MOH and CNC for the biggest price action. 

Medical devices: included within the repeal is the elimination of the medical device tax, so maybe companies like TMO and WAT would rally if it passes? Not as sure on this one but it's certainly a possibility.

In my opinion, I don't think it passes, so your best bet would be to go long hospitals/managed care where you'll see a significant relief rally. 

Anyone else have thoughts on this? What sectors are you bullish/bearish on leading up to the vote?

edit: CHC isn't a stock. CNC is.

#Trading Update

•   Market update – once again, there isn’t much to talk about overnight. China’s trade
numbers were the big macro headline but those figures are hardly changing the broader
macro narrative (exports fell slightly short while imports were inline). Otherwise the wires
were largely void of major headlines. Asia was mixed, Eurozone stocks are rallying nicely
(although are on track to end the week lower), and US futures are up a few points.

•   Calendar - for Friday investors will be watching US Dec PPI/retail sales (8:30amET), US
Michigan confidence for Jan (10amET), one Fed speaker (Harker), and earnings (BAC, BLK,
FHN, FRC, JPM, PNC, and WFC pre-open).

•   Eurozone stocks – the main Eurozone indices are seeing solid gains (up ~60-70bp). Most
major sub-groups are trading higher but tech, fin services, banks, media, and healthcare are
outperforming. Fiat Chrysler is rebounding as investors view its emissions scandal as less
severe than the one that hit VW although Renault is weak as Paris prosecutors open a probe
into its emissions. Technicolor is the weakest stock in the SXXP after cutting its outlook.
 

•   FX – the DXY is in the red again so far Fri morning (the DXY is tracking for a ~1% dip this
week). The USD is weak vs. the GBP and EUR and is flattish against the JPY. Investors are
looking forward to the Brexit speech on Tues from PM May.

•   Asia – the major Asian bourses were mixed: Japan (TPX +0.62%, NKY +0.8%), HK (Hang Seng
+0.47%, HSCEI +0.66%), mainland China (SHCOMP -0.21%, Shenzhen -1.55%), Korea (KOSPI -
0.5%), Australia (ASX 200 -0.79%), and India (flattish for the major indices). China’s trade
numbers were the big headline out of Asia (exports were a touch light while imports were
inline). The Bank of Korea decision was largely consistent w/expectations. In India, INFY
and TCS are both trading lower despite OK earnings from both. Taiwan didn’t trade very
badly despite the underwhelming TSMC guidance.

•   Japan – it was an extremely quiet and relatively uneventful trading session. Focus has
begun to turn to earnings with Retail +2.3% bouncing from recent weakness following Fast
Retailing +1.1% and Seven&i +8.6% earnings beat. Downside was led by Nintendo -5.8%,
trading close to 10% of total TPX turnover, as its 'Switch' presentation failed to impress -
especially with their $299.99 pricing (street was modeling more around $250~$275).
Otherwise, dispersion across sectors was low and larger moves were driven more by microheadlines:
Takata traded at limit high (+16.47%) after headlines saying the co and the US
Justice Department may announce a settlement as soon as Fri over air bags, SMM -4.7% got
hit after Nickel's weakness overnight, while Screen -4.0% traded lower on TSMC's weakerthan-
expected guidance for 1H '17.

•   Hong Kong - sector wise Coal outperformed +3.75% together with Chinese OEMs +2.8%
while Chinese Railways were down 0.4%. In the Chinese property sector, Vanke was well bid
+5.7% after China Resources Holdings has agreed to sell 15.3% of total shs out to Shenzhen
Metro Group at 37.2b yuan. In the Auto sector, Great Wall Motor spiked 2.7% after
announcing a positive profit alert; the rest of the sector traded higher. Despite a pullback of
the commodity complex, Steel +3% and Coal pushed higher driven mainly by further NDRCdriven
expectations of SOE reform/consolidation, China Shenhua +4.1% Angang Steel
+2.5%. The bounce in oil prices triggered a rally in Energy names, Sinopec putting on a
+3.57%, Petrochina +2.6%.


•   South Korea – the KOSPI ended off 0.5%. Samsung Electronics slumped ~3.45% following
tech weakness in the US on Thurs (note that Samsung did a lot worse than TSMC). Hynix
finished down ~0.59% (JPMorgan has a Hynix note this morning and recommends booking
profits instead of chasing the rally).

•   Taiwan – the TAIEX ended off 0.33%. TSMC fell 1.63% after its downbeat guidance
(although the local TSM did a lot better than the US ADR on Thurs which fell ~3%). The rest
of tech didn’t trade too badly despite TSM (MediaTek -0.92%, Hon Hai -0.12%, etc). On the
upside, outperformers included Advantech +1.5%, Quanta +0.79%, Pegatron +0.96%,
Innolux +1.17%, and AUO +1.16%.

•   US equity macro update - the multi-month rally has been underpinned by two main
developments: 1) improved nominal growth (which predated the election by a few months
and is largely politically agnostic for the near-term) and 2) GOD EMPEROR Trump enthusiasm. One of these
factors remains in place (growth) while the other is increasingly dubious (the political
optimism – see below). However, the market isn’t anticipating instant action out of
Washington and in fact the ’17 numbers (~$127-128) don’t really require any political/policy
changes (the problem is more w/the 2018 numbers where the tentative ~$145 EPS forecast
needs some assistance from Washington). Therefore investors may give the benefit of the
doubt to GOD EMPEROR Trump and Congressional Republicans until at least the end of the summer. This
faith though is finite and will likely wind up being disappointed as investors appreciate the
insurmountable complexity and tradeoffs of tax reform and realize that no government,
Republican or Democrat, can provide much added impetus to a full-employment economy
facing the twin structural headwinds of tepid labor supply and productivity growth.
 

#Top Headlines for Friday

•   China Dec trade numbers; slight export miss and inline imports – exports came in -6.1% (vs.
the St -4% and JPM -3.3%) while imports rose 3.1% (vs. the St +3% and JPM +3.4%).
Takeaways from JPMorgan’s Grace Ng - While December export growth, in over-year-ago
US$ terms, came in below expectations, in sequential terms, exports still rose 1.9%m/m sa,
adding to the notable gain at 3.3% m/m sa in November. Besides, imports came in line with
expectations, up 2.1% m/m sa in December, following the surge at 7.8% m/m sa in
November. Commodity imports came in rather mixed in December, although that followed
the notable broad-based gain in November. Looking ahead, the expected modest
improvement in global growth going into 2017, along with CNY’s trade-weighted adjustment
over the past year, would likely be moderately supportive for China’s external trade,
although uncertainty regarding potential US-China trade tensions poses notable risks.
http://bit.ly/2imQ8xz

•   China vs. US – a Chinese newspaper, the Global Times, said blocking Chinese access to its
islands in the South China Sea, an idea endorsed by Rex Tillerson during his confirmation
hearing, would require the US to “wage war”; ""Tillerson had better bone up on nuclear
power strategies if he wants to force a big nuclear power to withdraw from its own
territories” – Reuters http://reut.rs/2jDzLgS

•   China currency bears remain despite recent CNY strengthening – Reuters notes that the
PBOC may have tempered near-term cautiousness and given pause to short-term traders
but sentiment around the yuan is still very gloomy. http://reut.rs/2iri3zz

•   OPEC unlikely to deliver fully on cut pledge – Reuters notes that some cheating is inevitable
and OPEC apparently would be happy if compliance stays within a 50-80% band; OPEC
sources say compliance “is never 100%” and the cartel would be content so long as the
overall rate is north of 50% – Reuters http://reut.rs/2j7gPs0

•   Yellen spoke Thurs night although her remarks weren’t very incremental; Yellen said the
US economy doesn’t face any serious short-term obstacles. “Unemployment has now
reached a low level, the labor market is generally strong and wage growth is beginning to
pick up,” Yellen said Thursday in a meeting with educators. “Inflation has moved up from a
very low level, and it’s a little bit under our 2 percent objective, but it’s pretty close.”
Bloomberg http://bloom.bg/2in61nE

•   Fed unity – the WSJ notes how Fed officials, including hawks and doves, are expressing
remarkable unanimity in their policy outlooks. A slew of Fed officials spoke over the last few
days and most think the FOMC will hike rates 2-4 times this year (most appear comfortable
w/the current three hike outlook expressed by the median 2017 dot). WSJ
http://on.wsj.com/2jeH3Lk

•   Monetary vs. fiscal policy - the Fed continues to clearly warn Congress/GOD EMPEROR Trump that any
material fiscal stimulus would likely result in a faster withdrawal of accommodation (“Evans
Thurs morning became the latest in a series of Fed policymakers to quietly warn that this
may not be the best moment to launch a major fiscal plan or throw too much stimulus into
the economy” http://reut.rs/2j4IZUl).

•   US fiscal outlook weakens – the US had a deficit of $580B/3.1% of GDP in C16, up from 2.6%
in C15. The 2016 figure follows 6 years of shrinking deficits and the numbers are set to
worsen in the years ahead. WSJ http://on.wsj.com/2jcMomt

•   Tax reform/border taxes - Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) on Thursday defended the House
GOP border tax proposal and called it ""a little offensive"" that some U.S. companies are
criticizing it. ""This is not controversial, and quite frankly, it's a little offensive that some of
the major American companies that are importers who do business worldwide are even
raising concerns of this plan, because I don't see them going to Germany or Mexico or China
to raise these concerns” – The Hill http://bit.ly/2jLoQ9a
 

•   Border taxes - Larry Kudlow speaking on CNBC (at ~1:15pmET Thurs afternoon) is
vehemently against the idea of border taxes and worries that this issue could doom the
entire tax reform effort given how controversial it is. Kudlow at one point was being
considered for an economic job in the GOD EMPEROR Trump team (it isn’t clear where that consideration
stands now). GOD EMPEROR Trump hasn’t explicitly addressed the Ryan border tax blueprint.

•   Paul Ryan conducted a town hall on CNN Thurs night although there weren’t many
materially incremental headlines out of the event. Ryan reiterated a desire to pass ACA
replace legislation at the same as the repeal bills are approved. Ryan said Republicans are
moving ""as quickly as they can"" to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, but said he
doesn't yet have a date, and it will take ""a little bit of time"" to do so (CNN
http://cnn.it/2in0HR5).

•   Healthcare - the NYT details how GOD EMPEROR Trump’s healthcare promises will be difficult to achieve
(http://nyti.ms/2jLkQFK) while the WSJ discusses the bipartisan healthcare problem: “the
sick are expensive and someone has to pay” (http://on.wsj.com/2j7eIUU). The head of the
conservative House Freedom Caucus predicted Thursday that the GOP's ObamaCare
replacement plan is “likely to fail” in the Senate (The Hill http://bit.ly/2jqElzM).

•   GOD EMPEROR Trump’s team calls on Republicans to make childcare more affordable – GOD EMPEROR Trump aids are
instructing Congressional Republicans to incorporate measures into upcoming tax reform
legislation to make childcare more affordable. Proposals would allow parents to deduct
certain child care costs. Politico http://politi.co/2irsanV

•   Don’t Let the Dollar Inhibit Growth. A soaring currency could slow exports, fueling populist
anger. Time for another Plaza Accord? WSJ editorial. http://on.wsj.com/2iOJGjY

•   Int’l company-specific news update from Fri morning. The Infosys (out Thurs night US/preopen
India) and Tata Consultancy (out after the India close Thurs) earnings were decent but
both stocks are getting hit in India trading Fri morning. In Europe Fiat Chrysler is
rebounding as investors view its emissions scandal as less severe than the one that hit VW
although Renault is weak as Paris prosecutors open a probe into its emissions. Technicolor
is the weakest stock in the SXXP after cutting its outlook.

•   US company-specific news update from Thurs night. It was another pretty uneventful
evening. DOV provided F17 guidance – the top line was fine but the EPS guide was a bit
below the St. Pandora (P) published an upside preannouncement for CQ4 (the co also
announced restructuring actions). Finally, RYI said that it anticipates seasonally lower
revenue for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2016 due to fewer
shipping days.

#Calendar of events to watch for the week of Mon Jan 16

•   Bottom Line – the big focus during the week of 1/16 will be on earnings, US eco data (US CPI
for Dec Wed morning 1/18), the ECB decision (Thurs 1/19 – this should be a non-event),
China eco data (Dec IP/retail sales and Q4 GDP all out Thurs night/Fri morning), and two
Yellen speeches (she will take part in a discussion Wed 1/18 at 3pmET and speaks at
Stanford Thurs 1/19 at 8pmET). Also GOD EMPEROR Trump’s inauguration is Friday. Keep in mind Mon
1/16 is a holiday in the US (MLK Day).

•   Mon 1/16 – US markets are closed for MLK Day. BHP is scheduled to give its Q4 production
update Mon night.

•   Tues 1/17 – this day should be pretty quiet w/no major eco numbers and only a few
earnings (CMA, MS, and UNH pre-open and ADTN and CSX after the close). In addition, two
Fed officials will be speaking (Dudley, Williams), Chinese President Xi gives a keynote at the
Davos conf., and UK PM May is expected to give a “major” speech on Brexit.

•   Wed 1/18 – the big focus on Wed will be the US CPI for Dec at 8:30amET w/investors
watching inflation numbers closely. Also Yellen will participate in a discussion (3pmET) and
 
a bunch of earnings are due (AMTD, ASML, Burberry, C, FAST, GS, NTRS, SCHW, and USB
pre-open and NFLX, PLXS, PTC, and SLM after the close).

•   Thurs 1/19 – the ECB decision (7:45amET statement, 8:30amET press conf.) should be a
non-event. The other events include Yellen’s speech at Stanford (8pmET) and earnings
(BBT, BK, CHKP, KEY, PPG, UNP, and WBS pre-open and AXP, IBM, and SWKS after the
close).

•   Fri 1/20 – this day will be dominated by China’s eco data (Dec IP/retail sales and Q4 GDP
out Thurs night/Fri morning), earnings (CFG, COL, GE, KSU, RF, SLB, STI, and SYF pre-open),
and two Fed speakers (Harker and Williams). GOD EMPEROR Trump’s inauguration (he becomes president
at 12pmET) shouldn’t be all that important (although many are fearful of investors booking
profits on the “GOD EMPEROR Trump Trade” following this event).

#Catalysts for 2017 – big events to watch for 2017 (preliminary list – additional events likely to be
added)

•   US bank earnings season kicks off Fri 1/13 (BAC, BLK, FHN, FRC, JPM, PNC, and WFC all
report Fri morning).

•   Earnings - week of Mon 1/16 is the first big one of the CQ4 earnings season.

•   World Economic Forum 1/17-20 in Davos.

•   ECB – first ECB decision of the year will occur on Jan 19.

•   China eco data - Dec IP/retail sales/FAI and Q4 GDP – Fri morning 1/20.

•   ***GOD EMPEROR Trump inauguration Fri 1/20.***

•   Oil – OPEC and non-OPEC committee Jan 21-22 Vienna meeting (this will be the first
meeting to evaluate whether all the parties are adhering to the recent production
agreement).

•   Italy – Italian Constitutional Court to hold hearing on legitimacy of Italian electoral law on
Jan 24.

•   Japan – there is speculation Abe could call elections in the Jan timeframe.

•   US banks – the Fed will prob. publish the ’17 CCAR/stress test criteria around the end of Jan
(the criteria was released Jan 28, 2016 for the last testing cycle).

•   US GDP – the Q4 GDP number will be published Fri 1/27.

•   China New Year holiday. Mainland markets closed Fri 1/27-Thurs 2/2.

•   Fed – first Fed decision of the year will occur on Feb 1.

•   Netherlands will have national elections Mar 15.

•   Fed meeting – first press conf./dot plot decision of the year is Mar 15.


•   G20 Fin Min/central bank governors meeting Mar 17-18 in Germany.

•   China’s National People’s Congress (NPC) and Chinese People’s Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC) usually take place in mid-Mar; the gov’t will formally publish its 2017
economic objectives at this event.

•   US debt ceiling - the debt limit has been suspended since late ’15 but is due to be reinstated
on Mar 16, 2017.

•   EU Leaders Summit Mar 25 – this could be the forum at which the UK formally triggers
Article 50.

•   WFC’s “living will” – WFC will resubmit its living will in the Mar timeframe. Normally this
wouldn’t be a major event but if WFC’s living will is deemed inadequate again the Fed could
raise the company’s capital requirements.

•   France first-round presidential election Apr 23 (run-off is May 7).

•   US Treasury publishes semi-annual currency report around Apr timeframe (investors will
watch China’s designation closely and if it gets labeled a currency manipulator).

•   NATO – Montenegro is expected to become a NATO member in the spring of 2017.
 
•   G7 Leaders Summit May 26-27 in Italy.

•   Italy – new elections are likely in the June timeframe.

•   Russia – European sanctions against Russia are due to expire in June. Given the likely
outcome of the French election, they will prob. not be extended
(http://on.wsj.com/2iHEYUB).

•   China/MSCI - MSCI will announce the result of the China A shares inclusion proposal as part
of the 2017 Market Classification Review in June 2017.

•   G20 Leaders Summit Jul 7-8 2017 in Germany.

#Trading Update

•   Market update – once again, there isn’t much to talk about overnight. China’s trade
numbers were the big macro headline but those figures are hardly changing the broader
macro narrative (exports fell slightly short while imports were inline). Otherwise the wires
were largely void of major headlines. Asia was mixed, Eurozone stocks are rallying nicely
(although are on track to end the week lower), and US futures are up a few points.

•   Calendar - for Friday investors will be watching US Dec PPI/retail sales (8:30amET), US
Michigan confidence for Jan (10amET), one Fed speaker (Harker), and earnings (BAC, BLK,
FHN, FRC, JPM, PNC, and WFC pre-open).

•   Eurozone stocks – the main Eurozone indices are seeing solid gains (up ~60-70bp). Most
major sub-groups are trading higher but tech, fin services, banks, media, and healthcare are
outperforming. Fiat Chrysler is rebounding as investors view its emissions scandal as less
severe than the one that hit VW although Renault is weak as Paris prosecutors open a probe
into its emissions. Technicolor is the weakest stock in the SXXP after cutting its outlook.
 

•   FX – the DXY is in the red again so far Fri morning (the DXY is tracking for a ~1% dip this
week). The USD is weak vs. the GBP and EUR and is flattish against the JPY. Investors are
looking forward to the Brexit speech on Tues from PM May.

•   Asia – the major Asian bourses were mixed: Japan (TPX +0.62%, NKY +0.8%), HK (Hang Seng
+0.47%, HSCEI +0.66%), mainland China (SHCOMP -0.21%, Shenzhen -1.55%), Korea (KOSPI -
0.5%), Australia (ASX 200 -0.79%), and India (flattish for the major indices). China’s trade
numbers were the big headline out of Asia (exports were a touch light while imports were
inline). The Bank of Korea decision was largely consistent w/expectations. In India, INFY
and TCS are both trading lower despite OK earnings from both. Taiwan didn’t trade very
badly despite the underwhelming TSMC guidance.

•   Japan – it was an extremely quiet and relatively uneventful trading session. Focus has
begun to turn to earnings with Retail +2.3% bouncing from recent weakness following Fast
Retailing +1.1% and Seven&i +8.6% earnings beat. Downside was led by Nintendo -5.8%,
trading close to 10% of total TPX turnover, as its 'Switch' presentation failed to impress -
especially with their $299.99 pricing (street was modeling more around $250~$275).
Otherwise, dispersion across sectors was low and larger moves were driven more by microheadlines:
Takata traded at limit high (+16.47%) after headlines saying the co and the US
Justice Department may announce a settlement as soon as Fri over air bags, SMM -4.7% got
hit after Nickel's weakness overnight, while Screen -4.0% traded lower on TSMC's weakerthan-
expected guidance for 1H '17.

•   Hong Kong - sector wise Coal outperformed +3.75% together with Chinese OEMs +2.8%
while Chinese Railways were down 0.4%. In the Chinese property sector, Vanke was well bid
+5.7% after China Resources Holdings has agreed to sell 15.3% of total shs out to Shenzhen
Metro Group at 37.2b yuan. In the Auto sector, Great Wall Motor spiked 2.7% after
announcing a positive profit alert; the rest of the sector traded higher. Despite a pullback of
the commodity complex, Steel +3% and Coal pushed higher driven mainly by further NDRCdriven
expectations of SOE reform/consolidation, China Shenhua +4.1% Angang Steel
+2.5%. The bounce in oil prices triggered a rally in Energy names, Sinopec putting on a
+3.57%, Petrochina +2.6%.


•   South Korea – the KOSPI ended off 0.5%. Samsung Electronics slumped ~3.45% following
tech weakness in the US on Thurs (note that Samsung did a lot worse than TSMC). Hynix
finished down ~0.59% (JPMorgan has a Hynix note this morning and recommends booking
profits instead of chasing the rally).

•   Taiwan – the TAIEX ended off 0.33%. TSMC fell 1.63% after its downbeat guidance
(although the local TSM did a lot better than the US ADR on Thurs which fell ~3%). The rest
of tech didn’t trade too badly despite TSM (MediaTek -0.92%, Hon Hai -0.12%, etc). On the
upside, outperformers included Advantech +1.5%, Quanta +0.79%, Pegatron +0.96%,
Innolux +1.17%, and AUO +1.16%.

•   US equity macro update - the multi-month rally has been underpinned by two main
developments: 1) improved nominal growth (which predated the election by a few months
and is largely politically agnostic for the near-term) and 2) GOD EMPEROR Trump enthusiasm. One of these
factors remains in place (growth) while the other is increasingly dubious (the political
optimism – see below). However, the market isn’t anticipating instant action out of
Washington and in fact the ’17 numbers (~$127-128) don’t really require any political/policy
changes (the problem is more w/the 2018 numbers where the tentative ~$145 EPS forecast
needs some assistance from Washington). Therefore investors may give the benefit of the
doubt to GOD EMPEROR Trump and Congressional Republicans until at least the end of the summer. This
faith though is finite and will likely wind up being disappointed as investors appreciate the
insurmountable complexity and tradeoffs of tax reform and realize that no government,
Republican or Democrat, can provide much added impetus to a full-employment economy
facing the twin structural headwinds of tepid labor supply and productivity growth.
 

#Top Headlines for Friday

•   China Dec trade numbers; slight export miss and inline imports – exports came in -6.1% (vs.
the St -4% and JPM -3.3%) while imports rose 3.1% (vs. the St +3% and JPM +3.4%).
Takeaways from JPMorgan’s Grace Ng - While December export growth, in over-year-ago
US$ terms, came in below expectations, in sequential terms, exports still rose 1.9%m/m sa,
adding to the notable gain at 3.3% m/m sa in November. Besides, imports came in line with
expectations, up 2.1% m/m sa in December, following the surge at 7.8% m/m sa in
November. Commodity imports came in rather mixed in December, although that followed
the notable broad-based gain in November. Looking ahead, the expected modest
improvement in global growth going into 2017, along with CNY’s trade-weighted adjustment
over the past year, would likely be moderately supportive for China’s external trade,
although uncertainty regarding potential US-China trade tensions poses notable risks.
http://bit.ly/2imQ8xz

•   China vs. US – a Chinese newspaper, the Global Times, said blocking Chinese access to its
islands in the South China Sea, an idea endorsed by Rex Tillerson during his confirmation
hearing, would require the US to “wage war”; ""Tillerson had better bone up on nuclear
power strategies if he wants to force a big nuclear power to withdraw from its own
territories” – Reuters http://reut.rs/2jDzLgS

•   China currency bears remain despite recent CNY strengthening – Reuters notes that the
PBOC may have tempered near-term cautiousness and given pause to short-term traders
but sentiment around the yuan is still very gloomy. http://reut.rs/2iri3zz

•   OPEC unlikely to deliver fully on cut pledge – Reuters notes that some cheating is inevitable
and OPEC apparently would be happy if compliance stays within a 50-80% band; OPEC
sources say compliance “is never 100%” and the cartel would be content so long as the
overall rate is north of 50% – Reuters http://reut.rs/2j7gPs0

•   Yellen spoke Thurs night although her remarks weren’t very incremental; Yellen said the
US economy doesn’t face any serious short-term obstacles. “Unemployment has now
reached a low level, the labor market is generally strong and wage growth is beginning to
pick up,” Yellen said Thursday in a meeting with educators. “Inflation has moved up from a
very low level, and it’s a little bit under our 2 percent objective, but it’s pretty close.”
Bloomberg http://bloom.bg/2in61nE

•   Fed unity – the WSJ notes how Fed officials, including hawks and doves, are expressing
remarkable unanimity in their policy outlooks. A slew of Fed officials spoke over the last few
days and most think the FOMC will hike rates 2-4 times this year (most appear comfortable
w/the current three hike outlook expressed by the median 2017 dot). WSJ
http://on.wsj.com/2jeH3Lk

•   Monetary vs. fiscal policy - the Fed continues to clearly warn Congress/GOD EMPEROR Trump that any
material fiscal stimulus would likely result in a faster withdrawal of accommodation (“Evans
Thurs morning became the latest in a series of Fed policymakers to quietly warn that this
may not be the best moment to launch a major fiscal plan or throw too much stimulus into
the economy” http://reut.rs/2j4IZUl).

•   US fiscal outlook weakens – the US had a deficit of $580B/3.1% of GDP in C16, up from 2.6%
in C15. The 2016 figure follows 6 years of shrinking deficits and the numbers are set to
worsen in the years ahead. WSJ http://on.wsj.com/2jcMomt

•   Tax reform/border taxes - Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) on Thursday defended the House
GOP border tax proposal and called it ""a little offensive"" that some U.S. companies are
criticizing it. ""This is not controversial, and quite frankly, it's a little offensive that some of
the major American companies that are importers who do business worldwide are even
raising concerns of this plan, because I don't see them going to Germany or Mexico or China
to raise these concerns” – The Hill http://bit.ly/2jLoQ9a
 

•   Border taxes - Larry Kudlow speaking on CNBC (at ~1:15pmET Thurs afternoon) is
vehemently against the idea of border taxes and worries that this issue could doom the
entire tax reform effort given how controversial it is. Kudlow at one point was being
considered for an economic job in the GOD EMPEROR Trump team (it isn’t clear where that consideration
stands now). GOD EMPEROR Trump hasn’t explicitly addressed the Ryan border tax blueprint.

•   Paul Ryan conducted a town hall on CNN Thurs night although there weren’t many
materially incremental headlines out of the event. Ryan reiterated a desire to pass ACA
replace legislation at the same as the repeal bills are approved. Ryan said Republicans are
moving ""as quickly as they can"" to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, but said he
doesn't yet have a date, and it will take ""a little bit of time"" to do so (CNN
http://cnn.it/2in0HR5).

•   Healthcare - the NYT details how GOD EMPEROR Trump’s healthcare promises will be difficult to achieve
(http://nyti.ms/2jLkQFK) while the WSJ discusses the bipartisan healthcare problem: “the
sick are expensive and someone has to pay” (http://on.wsj.com/2j7eIUU). The head of the
conservative House Freedom Caucus predicted Thursday that the GOP's ObamaCare
replacement plan is “likely to fail” in the Senate (The Hill http://bit.ly/2jqElzM).

•   GOD EMPEROR Trump’s team calls on Republicans to make childcare more affordable – GOD EMPEROR Trump aids are
instructing Congressional Republicans to incorporate measures into upcoming tax reform
legislation to make childcare more affordable. Proposals would allow parents to deduct
certain child care costs. Politico http://politi.co/2irsanV

•   Don’t Let the Dollar Inhibit Growth. A soaring currency could slow exports, fueling populist
anger. Time for another Plaza Accord? WSJ editorial. http://on.wsj.com/2iOJGjY

•   Int’l company-specific news update from Fri morning. The Infosys (out Thurs night US/preopen
India) and Tata Consultancy (out after the India close Thurs) earnings were decent but
both stocks are getting hit in India trading Fri morning. In Europe Fiat Chrysler is
rebounding as investors view its emissions scandal as less severe than the one that hit VW
although Renault is weak as Paris prosecutors open a probe into its emissions. Technicolor
is the weakest stock in the SXXP after cutting its outlook.

•   US company-specific news update from Thurs night. It was another pretty uneventful
evening. DOV provided F17 guidance – the top line was fine but the EPS guide was a bit
below the St. Pandora (P) published an upside preannouncement for CQ4 (the co also
announced restructuring actions). Finally, RYI said that it anticipates seasonally lower
revenue for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2016 due to fewer
shipping days.

#Calendar of events to watch for the week of Mon Jan 16

•   Bottom Line – the big focus during the week of 1/16 will be on earnings, US eco data (US CPI
for Dec Wed morning 1/18), the ECB decision (Thurs 1/19 – this should be a non-event),
China eco data (Dec IP/retail sales and Q4 GDP all out Thurs night/Fri morning), and two
Yellen speeches (she will take part in a discussion Wed 1/18 at 3pmET and speaks at
Stanford Thurs 1/19 at 8pmET). Also GOD EMPEROR Trump’s inauguration is Friday. Keep in mind Mon
1/16 is a holiday in the US (MLK Day).

•   Mon 1/16 – US markets are closed for MLK Day. BHP is scheduled to give its Q4 production
update Mon night.

•   Tues 1/17 – this day should be pretty quiet w/no major eco numbers and only a few
earnings (CMA, MS, and UNH pre-open and ADTN and CSX after the close). In addition, two
Fed officials will be speaking (Dudley, Williams), Chinese President Xi gives a keynote at the
Davos conf., and UK PM May is expected to give a “major” speech on Brexit.

•   Wed 1/18 – the big focus on Wed will be the US CPI for Dec at 8:30amET w/investors
watching inflation numbers closely. Also Yellen will participate in a discussion (3pmET) and
 
a bunch of earnings are due (AMTD, ASML, Burberry, C, FAST, GS, NTRS, SCHW, and USB
pre-open and NFLX, PLXS, PTC, and SLM after the close).

•   Thurs 1/19 – the ECB decision (7:45amET statement, 8:30amET press conf.) should be a
non-event. The other events include Yellen’s speech at Stanford (8pmET) and earnings
(BBT, BK, CHKP, KEY, PPG, UNP, and WBS pre-open and AXP, IBM, and SWKS after the
close).

•   Fri 1/20 – this day will be dominated by China’s eco data (Dec IP/retail sales and Q4 GDP
out Thurs night/Fri morning), earnings (CFG, COL, GE, KSU, RF, SLB, STI, and SYF pre-open),
and two Fed speakers (Harker and Williams). GOD EMPEROR Trump’s inauguration (he becomes president
at 12pmET) shouldn’t be all that important (although many are fearful of investors booking
profits on the “GOD EMPEROR Trump Trade” following this event).

#Catalysts for 2017 – big events to watch for 2017 (preliminary list – additional events likely to be
added)

meeting to evaluate whether all the parties are adhering to the recent production
agreement).

Jan 24.

•   Japan – there is speculation Abe could call elections in the Jan timeframe.

TMO,wallstreetbets,Agilent Technologies Overview,"This constitutes a beginners effort to rationalize a trade...


**BASIC**  
Agilent is a company that ""provides laboratories worldwide with instruments, services, consumables, applications and expertise.""

NYSE: A    
Sector: Healthcare  
Industry: Medical Laboratories & Research  
Price per share: $42.62  
Market Cap: $14.0B  
Shares Outstanding: 327.8M  
Shares Float: 326.3  
Percent held by institutions: 86.8  
Short interest as a percent of float: 1.44  


**EARNINGS**   
A's next quarterly earnings (Q2) will be reported on May 16, AMC. The estimate is 0.39, up from a year ago's 0.38. The expected earning one fiscal year from then is 0.47. Without rambling off a bunch of numbers that one can easily look up oneself, i will note that in 2014 Agilent completed a spinoff company (NYSE: KEYS), and thus the sharp drop in share price and earnings in late October/early November of 2014 (http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20141117006373/en/Agilent-Technologies-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-2014-Results). Though this makes earnings growth hard to examine holistically over the past 3 or more years, all that is significant is that earnings grew before the spinoff, after the spinoff, and are expected to grow in the future--this is not GBSN.


Of the past 13 quarterly earnings reports, 5 beat estimates, and only 1 missed. 


**TECHNICAL**  
Agilent has been in a trading range for over a year, between about 42-44 above and 34-36 below. A is currently testing those highs and is even slightly above some of the more recent ones. I don't take much 'stock' in rsi/macd/bollinger voodoo.


**COMPETITOR COMPARISON**  
(Note: i consider competitors to be those that came up on the finviz screener after limiting results to the corresponding sector, industry and country, P/E over zero, Mkt Cap over 2B)  
*Agilent's P/E: 30.92       average of others: 30.02  
*P/B: 3.46                      others: 3.51  
*P/C: 7.25                      others: 25.83  
*P/S: 3.47                      others: 1.95  
*float short: 1.44%         others: 3.94%  
*profit margin: 11.20%   others: 7.26%  
*performance 1Y: 2.48% others: 21.85%  


**WHY DO WHAT/CONCLUSION**  
Agilent is better than or equal on all valuation metrics except for P/S. Its short interest at 2.14 days to cover is the lowest of the group. Despite all this, A's stock has appreciated the least. I think a breakout is a very good possibility.  
Comparable companies (TMO,DGX,LH) have not missed recent quarterly earnings, placing in the upper areas of estimates. I think is unlikely that A misses. If it meets it will likely react the way the above did--small pullback or uptick and then growth to new recent highs. Agilent is in the special situation however, that if it meets and rises say just another 1-2 dollars or especially if it beats, there is going to be some strong upward pressure after breaking from the channel. 


Possible plays (in order of decreasing dumbness):  
*(completely stupid): buy near-term puts or calls  
*(yolo): sell any otm or atm MAY20 puts before earnings  
*(risky): put credit spread before earnings  
*(tepid): wait for Agilent to break channel, then buy stock/calls/debit call spreads OR watch Agilent only meet or miss earnings and tumble back down into its channel and short stock buy puts/etc.  
*(pussyllanimous): buy stock if outbreak occurs  


the only issue is a big one: SPY (i suspect lower lows this week...)  
please note: this comment absolves me from any misprediction  
 

criticism is appreciated, both that which does or does not transcend an intellectual level of ""gfy, your mom has stage 3 autism"" ------thx

TMO,stocks,Anyone buying TMO (Thermo Fisher),"Seems to be a good company with established presence in science community. They sell all lab related equipment (from simple pipettes to complex stuff). They have only 2-3 competitors. 

The stock has been battered a lot due to current funding cuts for research. I feel this could be short lived (like everything else in this administration)

Stock is at 5 year low and at 23 PE. Technically its oversold in weekly charts (which is a rarity) There is no company specific bad news. I feel it should come back to 450 easily by year end.

TMO,stocks,Analyzing the Relationship Between Wikipedia Page Views and Stock Prices for TMO,"**Title:** Analyzing Wikipedia Page Views and Stock Prices for Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO) – Seeking Feedback

---

**Body:**

I recently came across a discussion on Reddit about using trends in Wikipedia page views to predict stock earnings reports. Intrigued by the idea, I decided to test this hypothesis on a stock I'm interested in: Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO). My initial thought was to plot Wikipedia page view data against stock prices, particularly around earnings reports, to see if there were any discernible trends or correlations.

Below is a summary of my findings, along with the analysis I conducted. I’d love to get some feedback from the community on whether I’m on the right track or if there are other angles I should explore.

### Key Visualizations:

- **[TMO Stock Price and Wikipedia Page Traffic](https://imgur.com/a/8svJ8ET)**
  - This plot shows the relationship between TMO's stock price and Wikipedia page views over the last five years.
  - The blue line represents TMO's adjusted stock price, while the green line represents Wikipedia page views.
  - Earnings announcements are marked with red dots.

### Key Points of the Analysis:

**Data Collection:**
- I pulled TMO stock price data from Yahoo Finance for the past five years.
- I gathered Wikipedia page traffic data for the ""Thermo Fisher Scientific"" page using the `pageviews` package.
- I also fetched earnings dates for TMO using the Alpha Vantage API.

**Initial Observations:**
- Surprisingly, my initial hypothesis didn’t hold. There seemed to be no clear relationship between spikes in Wikipedia page views and changes in TMO's stock price, even around earnings announcements.

### Event Study:

- **[Event Study: Impact of Earnings Announcements](https://imgur.com/a/myXJlF8)**
  - I performed an event study to examine stock returns and Wikipedia page views around earnings dates. The analysis showed no strong patterns linking earnings announcements to significant changes in either stock prices or Wikipedia page views.

I also analyzed the volatility of TMO stock around earnings dates. The results suggested that while Wikipedia page views fluctuated, they did not correlate with increased stock volatility.

TMO,stocks,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. The idea is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefore I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of numerous analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst, but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

This yielded the following table:

|+|A|B|C|D|E|F|G|H|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
**Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)**

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

What do you guys think?",20,23,1722536026.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ehnm3r/analyzing_the_analysts_using_average_analyst/,21_Points,"Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. The idea is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefore I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of numerous analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst, but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

This yielded the following table:

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
**Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)**

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

TMO,stocks,There isn't any purpose to being in the market this year or next!,"Ok guys I've been thinking tonight again!

I've come to the conclusion after many hours of pondering the subject that .... There is absolutely NO PURPOSE to being in the market at very least 2022 and most likely 2023!

I just can't see any of this getting better any time soon!

Tomorrow I will increase my SQQQ position size and the only stocks I will hold will be a few oil and maybe WMT! At least till 2024 or so!

I am going to cut my losses and get out while I'm ahead from my first 2.4 years investing! Yes, I'm still up a measly 18% for 2.4 years, but it's better than being 0 or less as we go down further.

I believe we may have a relief rally soon but in my opinion in won't amount to much. Maybe 1 or 2% portfolio up.

Then I'll exit to maybe 60% cash at least.

I hate to say this but I had a vision last night of the market getting down to about 2000 or so and not recovering till maybe 2024.

What I'll do is buy back in a little here and there at about 3000 or less on sp500.

I feel we should all be very careful now and preserve as much cash as possible.  All my new savings have been going directly to money market and is not entering the market. There is no point. All miney that enters now will just get gobbled up as we fall.

That's just my opinion, but on a serious note I just don't see ANY good in markets this year.

If you do please enlighten me. I just don't see it, but I am only a layman.

So my brothers, please be very careful. The only stocks I'll purchase after we hit 3000 or less will be things like MSFT AAPL GOOGL and maybe NVDA mostly.

Also I believe in UNH TMO SHW and HD.

I will also be purchasing some VTI once we hit 3000 or so as I believe that is a good entry point.

Stay safe all and remember that in a couple years I have hope that things will eventually get better if even only slightly.

Use this oppurtunity to purchase our equities at a large discount! But in my opinion right now is TOO SOON! The market has more purging to do!.... A lot more!

TMO,stocks,Quite a few blue chips beat the market. What's the catch?,"I own a few things like UNH SHW UNP and NEE. I also have a small amount in VTI.

I've noticed that the blue chips I have at least have outperformed the total market as far as back to 1985.

Using portfolio visualizer I punched in UNH SHW and VTSMX (same as VTI, but VTI only goes back so far).

From 2000 to 2022 here are the CAGRs

SHW 21% 

UNH 22%

VTSMX 7.7%

From 2005, 2011, 2017 to 2022 etc, those companies along with UNP NEE TMO and most other ""blue chips"" have handily beat the market return.

So why wouldn't people just invest in blue chips instead of the market?

I realize there's a little more ""risk"", but going back to 1985 Sherwin Williams for one example has returned 15% a year.  Whats wrong with that?

The same can be said for NEE UNP UNH TMO etc.

What's the catch? I own a few things like UNH SHW UNP and NEE. I also have a small amount in VTI.

I've noticed that the blue chips I have at least have outperformed the total market as far as back to 1985.

Using portfolio visualizer I punched in UNH SHW and VTSMX (same as VTI, but VTI only goes back so far).

From 2000 to 2022 here are the CAGRs

SHW 21% 

UNH 22%

VTSMX 7.7%

From 2005, 2011, 2017 to 2022 etc, those companies along with UNP NEE TMO and most other ""blue chips"" have handily beat the market return.

So why wouldn't people just invest in blue chips instead of the market?

I realize there's a little more ""risk"", but going back to 1985 Sherwin Williams for one example has returned 15% a year.  Whats wrong with that?

TMO,stocks,I've compiled a shortlist of companies that show strong growth potential.,"I've put together a shortlist of all the companies that have experienced significant revenue and net profit growth both in a 4 year time span as well as a 1 year time span, with respect to similar companies in their sector. My theory is that showing consistent results over this time period is indicative of strong fundamentals and will be a good investment over a period of at least one year. You'll see some common companies in here, as well as some not so common ones. But all of these are worth looking into.

I've put together a shortlist of all the companies that have experienced significant revenue and net profit growth both in a 4 year time span as well as a 1 year time span, with respect to similar companies in their sector. My theory is that showing consistent results over this time period is indicative of strong fundamentals and will be a good investment over a period of at least one year. You'll see some common companies in here, as well as some not so common ones. But all of these are worth looking into. 

Full disclaimer: I am invested in some of these.

TMO,stocks,$DHR vs $TMO,"I have a tiny position in TMO that I started today as I like the idea of medical equipment as an investment and these two stocks have historically done well and are blue chips.

How are these companies different in what they do?

Do they compete directly?

I see according to portfolio visualizer that DHR has returned about 7 million from a $10k investment from the 80s while TMO had returned over 1 million.

So it looks as though historically DHR has returned more to investors.

So should I just own both and put a little in each for long term?

I have about 1 share of TMO currently.  I'll add more if it corrects a little.",4,6,1627966960.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/owwe4r/dhr_vs_tmo/,apooroldinvestor,"$DHR vs $TMO I have a tiny position in TMO that I started today as I like the idea of medical equipment as an investment and these two stocks have historically done well and are blue chips.

TMO,stocks,"$TMO, $PENN or $CRI? Or all?","I'm looking for a blue chip medical devices stock to add to my portfolio.

I looked at a mutual fund and TMO was the heaviest followed by PEN (Penumbra) and CRL (Charles River).

I do have about 3% in FSMEX which is Fidelity's medical equipment mutual fund in my IRA, but I'm looking to overweight one of the stocks to generate alpha above the fund.

I used to have 5% in TMO in my IRA but got impatient and sold it with a small gain. I've only been investing 1.5 years so it wasn't long.

Anyways I realize about the ""can't go by past returns"" but since these are blue chips and an offset to my tech heavy portfolio (mostly semi equipment and MSFT AAPL GOOGL PYPL NVDA etc) I just plan on holding them for the long term.

So TMO returns were:

1987 to 2021 16+%

2000 to 2021 19+%

Also it's Sharpe is .58.  Whats that?
It's Sortino is .92.  What's that?

Thoughts on Penumbra or Charles River in comparison to TMO?

I don't know much other than they're medical equipment and I figure anything medical related, especially in an aging population will always be around and medical costs keep going up and up.

I looked at a mutual fund and TMO was the heaviest followed by PEN (Penumbra) and CRL (Charles River).

I do have about 3% in FSMEX which is Fidelity's medical equipment mutual fund in my IRA, but I'm looking to overweight one of the stocks to generate alpha above the fund.

I used to have 5% in TMO in my IRA but got impatient and sold it with a small gain. I've only been investing 1.5 years so it wasn't long.

Anyways I realize about the ""can't go by past returns"" but since these are blue chips and an offset to my tech heavy portfolio (mostly semi equipment and MSFT AAPL GOOGL PYPL NVDA etc) I just plan on holding them for the long term.

So TMO returns were:

1987 to 2021 16+%

2000 to 2021 19+%

2011 to 2021 24+%

2016 to 2021 27+%

TMO,stocks,Want to invest in biotech? A quick guide.,"Short answer: don't. I work in the industry and learned early on not to touch it with a ten-foot pole. If you want to invest in the pharma/biopharma/biotech industry, investing in small-cap biotech stocks - MBIO, VKTX, ATOS, etc. for examples is basically gambling. Here are the alternatives I suggest.

Supply chain. TMO and AVTR are the two biggest suppliers of consumables in the life sciences industry and essentially hold a duopoly. Both are basically trying to position themselves as the amazon of the industry. TMO is more diversified offering various services and high-powered equipment and is on the cutting-edge of R&D in a lot of equipment fields (MS and cryo-EM). AVTR owns VWR which is basically like an Amazon/costco hybrid for companies and academia. I highly recommend choosing one or both.

Equipment. TMO/AVTR kind of fall into this category but I wanted to make a different section because they pretty much own the entire consumables market. Instrumentation has a lot more competition. While something like TMO has its hands dipped into everything, almost nobody would choose a TMO HPLC over Agilent (A) or Waters (WAT). PCR? Bio-Rad (BIO). Centrifuges? Beckman Coulter (DHR). A lot of companies have carved out niches for themselves whereas something like TMO is a generalist. You also have companies like DHR that hold brands like Beckman Coulter that have a lot of brand loyalty.

Services. CROs like IQVIA, PPD, manufacturing services, instrumentation (calibration, maintenance) services etc. One of the most expensive things about the industry is the regulatory hurdles, especially clinical trials. CROs help companies save money on clinical trials by outsourcing them to companies already equipped to handle different parts of them. Equipment has to have records of being ""up to spec"" for audit purposes and a lot of companies do this stuff in-house or let the vendors send service techs out. You also have companies like TMO with their unity service that do this stuff. They also recently bought out Patheon and PPD so they're expanding the services side of their company a lot.

Tech. This sort of falls under equipment and services so I won't spend too long on it, but companies like Illumina have revolutionized things in their fields (DNA sequencing for Illumina).

In terms of innovation in tech/equipment, chromatography, mass spec, sequencing, cryo-EM and Big Data are the future.

Big pharma/biopharma/biotech. You can still benefit from the excitement of a positive clinical trial result without the volatility. The issue with small-cap biotech is that you'll bleed out 70% over the course of a few months, and by the time you get that 25% bump from a positive trial result you're still extremely deep in the red. These companies completely hinge on a very small amount of drugs which is why they're such a gamble. Companies like PFE, ABBV have blockbuster drugs under their belt that keep them relatively stable and allow them to pay dividends. The 25% bump from a positive result you'd see from biotech is buffered to be more like 5-10%, but at least you know you won't (probably) lose 90% of your investment.

Last but not least... ETFs. Pharma, biotech and medical devices ETFs all hold a lot of these aforementioned categories/companies.

TMO,stocks,5 Considerations When Picking Stocks for Long-Term Growth,"Like many of you, I started actively investing a year and a half ago. The recent rotation was a rude awakening for me because it specifically impacted growth, tech, and renewables (the majority of my holdings).

I have since taken on a cautiously aggressive strategy of picking individual stocks that pass five tests. I wanted to run my theory by this group to hear your thoughts. Note, I’m not trying to find deep value stocks or ten-baggers or anything – just solid doers that have a good chance of outperforming the market for many years to come.

**Test 1: Will I feel good owning this six years from now?**

Think of getting your driver’s license photo taken. When I most recently renewed my license, I had a huge beard, and now I’m stuck with that photo for most of my 30s. Of course you don’t need to hold a stock that long. But I think it’s a good framework for analyzing stocks, because they really should be longer term investments. Is this a company that will still be doing well in six years? Can I take myself seriously holding this for that long?

**Test 2: What’s the P/E ratio?**

Nothing new here. But it’s usually the next thing I consider. 12 to 24 great. 25 to 34 understandable. 35-49 caution. 50+ or negative, too speculative.

**Test 3: Did it already moon?**

This was an oversight with one of my original picks. The stock had been trading in the teens in 2019 and was around $100/share when I first bought it. Averaging down is no fun. If a stock mooned anytime in the last 5 years, you might have to accept you missed the ticket. Check 10, 20+ years back for older companies to gain more context.

**Test 4: How linear is its growth?**

Ideally I’d like to see a perfectly straight line over the past 5 years. Something that steadily marches upward over time with minimal volatility, and something that has gained between roughly 125-250% over the past 5 years. While I think lots of companies will do well as companies, I’m hesitant to invest in them if their history looks like a roller coaster. I especially take note of how a company did through 2018-2019, how it did before the Covid crash vs. after, and how it did these past couple months.

**Test 5: How are their quarterly earnings?**

Maybe this goes without saying, but I think a company's profitability is a good indication of whether it will do well in the future. It’s nice to see the past 5 earning reports beat expectations, though 4 out of 5 isn’t bad either.

Of course, it’s hard for any stock to pass all five tests, and if I was a purist I probably wouldn’t be very diversified. Some stocks that fit closely with these criteria include UNP, GOOGL, V, HD, DG, TMO, SPGI, and TXN. (This is not financial advice.) Can you think of any others?",150,37,1616827758.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/me8kb3/5_considerations_when_picking_stocks_for_longterm/,MinnesotaPower,"5 Considerations When Picking Stocks for Long-Term Growth Like many of you, I started actively investing a year and a half ago.

TMO,stocks,Advice on what to add to my portfolio needed 💵,"Hello looking for some advice on some stocks to add positions to in the coming weeks/months. I have about 50K of cash ready to deploy at appropriate moments, not all of it at once necessarily, but looking for good entry points, primarily in tech and growth sectors. All these positions will be long holds at minimum 5 years ideally 10-15 for most. I am 24 years old I have a fairly well diversified portfolio that I have been growing and building for a little less than a decade; holdings are listed below. I have a medium - high risk tolerance for this final chunk of cash to deploy. I'm planning to potentially increase my positions in PLTR, FB, DOCU PYPL and DIS and maybe a few others but as I said I'm also looking for some names to add that aren't on this list. I'd like to find a few names that have lots of room for potential growth even if they are on the risky side but high potential payouts. I have a well balanced portfolio with a large percentage of my assets in ETF's and low risk assets so I'm looking for a few more speculative, aggressive plays to make, any and all advice is welcome; as well as comments/critiques on my current holdings.

I have a well balanced portfolio with a large percentage of my assets in ETF's and low risk assets so I'm looking for a few more speculative, aggressive plays to make, any and all advice is welcome; as well as comments/critiques on my current holdings. 


UPDATE: Thanks for the advice friends I added some positions

TMO,stocks,"Should you chase financials and industrials, etc?","i have a heavy tech weighted portfolio and while I'm not overly worried I'm wondering if I should be adding JPM and BAC and more industrials to my portfolio or maybe even just adding to my Total Market index.

I realize people are running scared from tech now due to various reasons and the rising 10 yr.

I'm in it though for at least 10 years or more.  Should I be worried about tech and chasing recent market rotations?  I thought that wasn't the thing to do? I feel like I'd be betraying my tech 😆!!  Just joking.

I also see that on average banks and industrials have been rather bad performers for over a decade.

I realize they're ""beat up"", but why would people be moving their money into banks if they don't return much??

Is it that they ""have no where else to put their money"" when rotating from tech?

I realize also it's mostly the big money or smart money that moves the market and not small timers like me.

So should I just hold my tech?

I'm not just tech though, I'm diversified.

Here are some holdings for example.

TMO,stocks,Friday 26 February 2021: A discount bot I have created.,"Friday 26 February 2021

*Live Updates*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Background:**

* My discount bot to help Reddit. It took me almost a year to develop it to my standard.
* My private codes was used to develop it, and it's very unlikely I will sell it off to anyone or publish the code freely as it took me way too long to develop it. I rather post updates freely, at no cost to anyone than give out the code.
* I will not be posting this hourly. It just too long to load everything up maybe in the future. I will post during open though.
* Discord and telegram admins, don't try to monetize my bot suggestions to vulnerable people, when you don't even own the codes behind it.
* There are a lot of SPY500/""boomer"" companies within the bot, I thought about removing it but many people preferred that I kept it in there.
* There won't be any sell signals, as stocks only go up, so I rather just do a discount algorithm.
* Batch 1 = Algorithm/Bot + Human Judgement
* Batch 2 = Algorithm/Bot Judgement Only
* This is a one man bot.

**Bot Overview**:

It's showing an opportunity that you may have missed otherwise, so you can decide for yourself if you want to pursue the discount of a stock for potential profits. Backtesting has not been done, do not YOLO your life savings into whatever stated risking it all.  Rather use this as a side tool.

**Key:**

* Penny stocks are very risky.
* Pharma companies are very risky.
* Meme/Hype stocks are very risky.
* Companies that you don't know how they work are very risky.
* Follower companies are very risky because they join the hype train (what NKLA is to TSLA).
* I have a very low amount in options (less than $500), and I have 100k+ in shares and cash.
* When doing options have a lot of collateral, so you don't hit margin call.
* Take the ""Calls"" as very discounted, and ""Potentially A Call"" as somewhat discounted.
* Old money companies are slow. While tech companies are fast-paced.
* Only invest in companies that you do know and see potential in.
* You don't have to invest every day, only when you see the potential.

TMO,stocks,Non-Tech Stocks to Diversify Your Portfolio,"So I've gone through countless threads and done a bit of research on this topic these past several days as I've realized that maybe having a 100% tech portfolio is not a great idea. I'm sure that some of yall have thought about this as well considering that a lot of people here probably started investing during 2020 and tech stocks were and still are all everyone is talking about. So here are some great non-tech stocks you can open positions in to diversify a little bit.

&#x200B;

**ABT (Abbott Laboratories)**: One of the biggest medical companies in the world, been around for a long time, founded in 1888. HUGE supplier of covid testing.  They make Pharmaceutical Products, Diagnostic Products, Nutritional Products, and Medical Devices. The Company focuses on cardiovascular, diabetes care, diagnostics, neuromodulation, nutrition and medicine. Beat earnings in every quarter of 2020. 

**NIKE**: A staple in so many different industries. Pro sports, high school and college sports, sneaker culture, clothing, fitness, etc. They're not going anywhere.

**PAWZ (ProShares Pet Care ETF)**: people love their pets. simple. Up 67% in the past year.

**TMO (Thermo Fisher Scientific)**:  ""Company that dominates the biotech supply chain. Their products will be seen in every single lab all over the world. You want to run a gel, isolate DNA/RNA, proteins, want to buy fluorescent probes, dyes, standards, want to run western blots, run mass spec sample preps, hell - do you want to buy a mass spec instrument? They have got it all. Pays a small dividend too. They are obviously struggling in the sequencing space, which is dominated by illumina. DNA synthesis also seems to be burgeoning in smaller companies such as IDT or trilink. But TMO has a good coverage for all sorts of lab needs."" -u/Nosemyfart

**TGT (Target)**: Eigth largest retailer in the US. Analysts seem to like it more than walmart and costco. tbh you could probably just throw walmart, target, costco, caseys, etc. on a dartboard and buy whichever one you hit.

Honorable Mentions: DIS, renewable energy stocks, DG, PG, JNJ, LULU, CVNA, utilities, materials

TMO,stocks,(2/9) Tuesday's Pre-Market Stock Movers & News,"#Good morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to Tuesday! Here are your pre-market stock movers & news on this Tuesday morning-

*****

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Tuesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/09/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-february-9-2021.html)

*****

> # 1. Dow set to dip after six-session win streak

> * U.S. stock futures fell Tuesday, taking a pause after the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 rose for their sixth straight sessions and the Nasdaq did so for its third session in a row. All three benchmarks logged record-high closes. February’s blistering gains ahead of Tuesday’s trading on Wall Street sent the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq up nearly 4.7%, 5.4% and 7%, respectively.

*****

> # 2. Trump’s second impeachment trial to begin in Senate

> * Former President Donald Trump faces the start of his second impeachment trial, an uphill battle for Democrats determined to prove him guilty for inciting last month’s deadly riot at the U.S. Capitol. Despite the unprecedented circumstances, experts see acquittal as the likely outcome. Out of office for nearly three weeks, the one-term Republican president, ensconced at his Florida home, still commands the support of swaths of the party and the loyalty of many GOP lawmakers, who largely doubt the legality of the trial itself. The trial is scheduled to start at 1 p.m. ET.

*****

> # 3. CBO says federal minimum wage of $15 would cost jobs

> * Raising the federal minimum wage from $7.25 per hour in annual increments to $15 per hour, as President Joe Biden has proposed, would cost 1.4 million jobs over the next four years while lifting 900,000 people out of poverty, according to a report released Monday by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The hike would add to the budget deficit, which could help Democrats pull the issue into the budget reconciliation process. Doing so could enable the Democrats to pass Biden’s $1.9 trillion Covid stimulus approach with no Republican votes. As part of the pandemic relief effort, House Democrats on Monday proposed a faster income phase-out for the next round of direct payments checks.

*****

> # 4. WHO says animals to humans ‘most likely’ path of coronavirus

> * An international team of scientists led by the World Health Organization said Tuesday the search for how the coronavirus was introduced remains a “work in progress,” but the “most likely” pathway was indeed from animals to humans. Scientists have been working for the past four weeks in the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the coronavirus was first identified in late 2019. The team dismissed a leak from a lab, saying that such theories should be regarded as “extremely unlikely.”

*****

> # 5. Reddit’s valuation doubles to $6 billion after new funding

> * Reddit — ground zero for the recent online-driven individual investor trading mania — raised more than $250 million in a new round of funding, doubling its valuation to $6 billion. Activity in Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum sparked a frenzy of buying in heavily shorted stocks, sending names like GameStop skyrocketing last month. Shares of the video game retailer — which lost 70% last week after soaring 400% the previous week — dropped another 5.9% on Monday and were under pressure in Tuesday’s premarket.

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Tuesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/09/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-february-9-2021.html)

*****

> # 1. Dow set to dip after six-session win streak

> * U.S. stock futures fell Tuesday, taking a pause after the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 rose for their sixth straight sessions and the Nasdaq did so for its third session in a row. All three benchmarks logged record-high closes. February’s blistering gains ahead of Tuesday’s trading on Wall Street sent the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq up nearly 4.7%, 5.4% and 7%, respectively.

*****

> # 2. Trump’s second impeachment trial to begin in Senate

> * Former President Donald Trump faces the start of his second impeachment trial, an uphill battle for Democrats determined to prove him guilty for inciting last month’s deadly riot at the U.S. Capitol. Despite the unprecedented circumstances, experts see acquittal as the likely outcome. Out of office for nearly three weeks, the one-term Republican president, ensconced at his Florida home, still commands the support of swaths of the party and the loyalty of many GOP lawmakers, who largely doubt the legality of the trial itself. The trial is scheduled to start at 1 p.m. ET.

*****

> # 3. CBO says federal minimum wage of $15 would cost jobs

> * Raising the federal minimum wage from $7.25 per hour in annual increments to $15 per hour, as President Joe Biden has proposed, would cost 1.4 million jobs over the next four years while lifting 900,000 people out of poverty, according to a report released Monday by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The hike would add to the budget deficit, which could help Democrats pull the issue into the budget reconciliation process. Doing so could enable the Democrats to pass Biden’s $1.9 trillion Covid stimulus approach with no Republican votes. As part of the pandemic relief effort, House Democrats on Monday proposed a faster income phase-out for the next round of direct payments checks.

*****

> # 4. WHO says animals to humans ‘most likely’ path of coronavirus

> * An international team of scientists led by the World Health Organization said Tuesday the search for how the coronavirus was introduced remains a “work in progress,” but the “most likely” pathway was indeed from animals to humans. Scientists have been working for the past four weeks in the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the coronavirus was first identified in late 2019. The team dismissed a leak from a lab, saying that such theories should be regarded as “extremely unlikely.”

*****

> # 5. Reddit’s valuation doubles to $6 billion after new funding

> * Reddit — ground zero for the recent online-driven individual investor trading mania — raised more than $250 million in a new round of funding, doubling its valuation to $6 billion. Activity in Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum sparked a frenzy of buying in heavily shorted stocks, sending names like GameStop skyrocketing last month. Shares of the video game retailer — which lost 70% last week after soaring 400% the previous week — dropped another 5.9% on Monday and were under pressure in Tuesday’s premarket.

TMO,stocks,Thermo Fisher (TMO) - Supplier of lab equipment and reagents for genetic testing (among other fields),"My wife is a forensic scientist and a while ago I was asking her about some of the equipment they use in their lab.  She said there are only a few companies that handle the majority of equipment used in these labs.

One she mentioned was Thermo Fisher. 

Here's their business summary from Schwab:

> Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. develops, manufactures and sells a range of products. The Company operates through four segments: Life Sciences Solutions, Analytical Instruments, Specialty Diagnostics, and Laboratory Products and Services. It offers its products and services through various brands, including Thermo Scientific, Applied Biosystems, Invitrogen, Fisher Scientific and Unity Lab Services. 

> * Life Sciences Solutions segment provides a portfolio of reagents, instruments and consumables used in biological and medical research, discovery and production of new drugs and vaccines. 
> * Analytical Instruments segment provides a broad offering of instruments, consumables, software and services that are used for a range of applications in the laboratory. 
> * Specialty Diagnostics segment offers a wide range of diagnostic test kits, reagents, culture media, instruments and associated products. 
> * Its Laboratory Products and Services segment offers products and solutions needed for the laboratory.

With the surge of genetic focused research, I was thinking TMO might be in a really good position for some future growth if more labs open that focus on DNA / genetics / genomic research.

If you don't want to try to pick and choose which genetic companies are going to succeed and you already own ARKG, Thermo Fisher might be another worth looking into.

The share price might be considered a high entry point for a lot of people (~$490 today), but it's been a solid growth stock for me.  It does have a dividend, although it's laughably small (0.18% annual dividend yield).

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning July 20th, 2020.

# **Earnings and fiscal debate could be catalysts for stocks in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/17/earnings-and-fiscal-debate-could-be-catalysts-for-stocks-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> Investors are braced for a barrage of earnings news, and the debate in Washington around the next stimulus package may also be an important catalyst for markets since it has implications for the economic recovery.
*****
> Big tech names, including Microsoft, Intel, Twitter and IBM, are among companies reporting in the week ahead, as is high-flying Tesla. Blue chips Coca-Cola, Verizon, American Express and Travelers are also among the dozens of major companies releasing results.
*****
> Congress returns from its break and should pick up the pace of negotiations towards a new fiscal stimulus package, which is expected to address aid for state and local governments and enhanced unemployment benefits. Unemployment benefits, including the $600 additional weekly payment now going to millions, is expected to be a hot topic of discussion, as the benefit ends on July 31.
*****
> There are just a few items of note on the economic calendar, including existing home sales on Wednesday, unemployment claims data on Thursday and new home sales on Friday.
*****
> The spread of the coronavirus will also be closely monitored, as well as any signs of medical progress. The Lancet medical journal is expected to release early stage human trial data Monday on a vaccine developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca.
*****
> # ‘Push and pull’ in market
> Investors also will be watching the market’s own dynamics in the week ahead. There is tension within the market between the bubbly run-up of tech and momentum names on the Nasdaq, and the broader market, or S&P 500, which is basically still flat for the year. The Nasdaq is up 17% year to date, but in the past week lagged other indices, turning in a loss, while the Dow and S&P 500 were both higher.
*****
> The Nasdaq’s outperformance came to an abrupt end Monday, and it has lagged since then. In dramatic fashion, the index rose sharply to new highs, with many big tech names and Tesla also hitting highs. Within the same session, there was a massive reversal in the index and in tech and momentum names, and they closed sharply lower.
*****
> Now strategists are watching to see if the froth will be let out slowly or blow off in a big move that takes the rest of the market with it.
*****
> “We expect the push and pull of the Nasdaq to continue and have sustained volatility, in our view, throughout the earnings season,” said Julian Emanuel, head of equity and derivatives strategy at BTIG. “Volatility could be to the upside, as well as the downside, but in our view, in aggregate, the Nasdaq is likely to correct.”
*****
> Emanuel said the volatile reversal in the Nasdaq does not bode well for the Nasdaq, and it could see a 10% correction. There’s been a surge of retail activity in some of the frothiest names, such as Tesla, which surged from about $1,000 at the end of June to a high of $1,795 during Monday’s session. It is since about $300 per share lower.
*****
> “The combination of public participation and just incredible valuations makes the sector very, very vulnerable. ... It’s the sector with the highest earnings expectations,” said Emanuel. “There’s virtually nothing that management can say at these valuations that’s going to create further upside to these names.”
*****
> Tesla and Microsoft report earnings Wednesday, and Twitter reports Thursday.
*****
> # A bump up in stimulus
> As Congress heads back to Washington in the coming week, expectations are rising that the fiscal stimulus package could be slightly more than Republicans were previously expected to approve.
*****
> When Congress broke for the July 4 holiday, there was a big divide on how much stimulus should be added, on top of the $2.4 trillion already adopted. The Democratic proposal was for $3 trillion, while Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said no more than $1 trillion. Now the gulf has narrowed, but House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the $1.3 trillion under discussions is not enough.
*****
> Cornerstone Macro’s Andy Laperriere said the package could now be $1.5 trillion or more, more than he expected just several weeks ago. He said more money is now expected for state and local governments, local schools, public health, virus testing and payments to support individuals..
*****
> “Republicans really want to use this bill to encourage and incentivize businesses and schools to open. But I think the big thing is a month ago, the top priority of Republicans was to keep this bill small,” he said.
*****
> One of the most controversial elements of the CARES stimulus package was the $600 weekly payment to people who were already collecting unemployment.
*****
> The payment is likely to be significantly reduced and then ultimately phased out, but that will only come after compromise. “There’s going to be some lines-in-the-sand issues, and this is one of them,” said Laperriere, head of policy at Cornerstone.
*****
> President Donald Trump has said he won’t sign the bill unless there is a payroll tax cut, which was previously rejected by Congress. Payroll taxes are paid by both employers and employees, and they fund government programs, including Medicare and Social Security.
*****
> Strategists said the market could react to the deliberations if they take longer than expected, or the funds are viewed as insufficient.
*****
> Michael Schumacher, Wells Fargo director of rate strategy, said the bond market will focus on how quickly the government plans to payout the stimulus and also the degree to which the Treasury will ultimately have to increase auction sizes to pay for it.
*****
> If Congress keeps to its schedule, it needs to approve the package before the end of the month, when it heads to another recess for the entire month of August.

# The Good and the Bad from Earnings This Week

> Earnings season began at the start of this week with Pepsi (PEP) and the first of the major US banks and brokers reporting Q2 numbers. It was a light week with only 32 companies reporting through Thursday, but in the coming weeks, we'll see 100+ reports on multiple trading days.

> From our Earnings Explorer tool, below is a recap of the results from this week's earnings reports. 78% of companies that reported this week beat consensus analyst EPS estimates, while 72% topped consensus sales estimates. Those are both strong numbers. In terms of future projections, 16% of companies raised guidance, and not one company lowered guidance. That's rare even with the very low number of reports so far.

> While guidance and beat rates were strong, investors still used earnings reports as an opportunity to sell. The average one-day share price change this week for companies in reaction to their earnings reports was a decline of 0.57%. All of those declines came on the initial gap down at the open, however. After averaging a gap down of 0.76% at the open of trading following the earnings release, the average stock that reported gained 0.21% from the open to the close. (The gap down of 0.76% and the open to close gain of 0.21% adds up to the full-day decline of 0.57% mentioned earlier.)

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/earnings.png))**

> Below is a table showing all 32 companies that reported Q2 numbers this week (through Thursday). The list is sorted by one-day share price reaction from best to worst. Alcoa (AA) had the best price reaction to earnings this week with a gain of 6.39% yesterday. WNS Global (WNS) put up the second-biggest gain at 6.36%. The next best-performing stocks in reaction to earnings this week only gained 3%+ -- USB and HOMB. Other stocks that reported this week that gained in response to their earnings reports include Morgan Stanley (MS), Goldman Sachs (GS), Taiwan Semi (TSM), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), and JP Morgan (JPM).

> On the downside, AngioDynamics (ANGO) saw the worst share price reaction to earnings this week when it fell 11.51% on Thursday. Sleep Number (SNBR) was second-worst with a one-day drop of 9.19% yesterday as well.

> While MS, GS, and JPM all posted gains in reaction to earnings this week, other banks like Citi (C), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Bank of America (BAC) reacted negatively with each falling 4% or more.

*****

# Retail Sales Beat Again

> Retail sales data for June was reported on Thursday, handily beating expectations for the second consecutive month. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, June saw a 7.5% increase month over month, compared with Bloomberg’s consensus expectations for a 5% gain. This comes on the heels of a more than 18% gain in May, but also following by far the lowest reading ever, a 14.7% decline in April.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/7.17.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> Pent-up demand and the continued easing of lockdowns during June likely contributed to the large increase, which saw sales rise across most categories. Sales spiked 8.2% at auto dealers, but even sales excluding autos and gas rose 6.7%. Clothing store sales more than doubled (+105.1%) while sales in the hard-hit food services and drinking places climbed 20%.

> “Consumer spending is still far below pre-pandemic levels and many of the real-time data we are monitoring have begun to level off in the past month,” said LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “We remain encouraged by the strong rebound in May and June, but would expect more gradual gains for retail sales in the second half of the year.”

*****

# Why A Potential Democrat Sweep May Not Be A Market Worry

> Based on the latest polling data, there’s growing consensus that former Vice President Joe Biden potentially may win the election and Democrats possibly may sweep Congress. Some might think this could be a negative for stocks, as a higher corporate tax rate that reduces earnings could be part of the Democratic platform.

> Early writers of the US Constitution were worried about one party having too much power that could enable factions in Washington, DC, to enact more extreme policies and political ideals, upsetting the carefully balanced apple cart. As we noted in our recently released Midyear Outlook 2020, stocks historically have performed quite well when Congress has been split, although stocks actually have done better than most probably realized when the Democrats were in full control.

> “Higher corporate taxes are quite likely should we see a potential Democratic sweep,” said LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But to blindly say stocks will do poorly is quite a stretch, as historically stocks have done rather well under this .”

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&P 500 Index has been higher 9 of the past 10 times and 15 of the past 18 times Democrats controlled both the White House and Congress. Although LPL Research anticipates a likely split Congress in November, with the list of overall worries growing, we don’t think a potential Democratic sweep should be at the top of investors’ list of worries.

# Best of July Likely Over

> NASDAQ’s mid-year rally came to an end on Tuesday, July 14. During the rally’s 12-day stretch beginning on the third to last day of June through the ninth trading day in July, NASDAQ gained 4.7%. This is well above its average performance since 1985 but less than half of its best showing from 1999. At NASDAQ’s high close during the rally on July 10 it was up 6.0%. Historically around this time in July is when the market has begun to weaken as NASDAQ’s full-month average performance is just 0.9% since 1985.

> In the following chart, July’s seasonal pattern over the last 21 years has been plotted with July 2020, plotted on the right axis for comparison through yesterday’s close. This July’s well above average performance so far called for a second, larger range in order to aid in the comparison. Over the last 21 years the market’s trend has been lower beginning right around mid-month through the close. DJIA, S&P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 & 2000 have on average given back some or all of their first half of July gains.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/stocks.",76,15,1595080979.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/hth3dq/wall_street_week_ahead_for_the_trading_week/,bigbear0083,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning July 20th, 2020 Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning July 20th, 2020.

# **Earnings and fiscal debate could be catalysts for stocks in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/17/earnings-and-fiscal-debate-could-be-catalysts-for-stocks-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> Investors are braced for a barrage of earnings news, and the debate in Washington around the next stimulus package may also be an important catalyst for markets since it has implications for the economic recovery.
*****
> Big tech names, including Microsoft, Intel, Twitter and IBM, are among companies reporting in the week ahead, as is high-flying Tesla. Blue chips Coca-Cola, Verizon, American Express and Travelers are also among the dozens of major companies releasing results.
*****
> Congress returns from its break and should pick up the pace of negotiations towards a new fiscal stimulus package, which is expected to address aid for state and local governments and enhanced unemployment benefits. Unemployment benefits, including the $600 additional weekly payment now going to millions, is expected to be a hot topic of discussion, as the benefit ends on July 31.
*****
> There are just a few items of note on the economic calendar, including existing home sales on Wednesday, unemployment claims data on Thursday and new home sales on Friday.
*****
> The spread of the coronavirus will also be closely monitored, as well as any signs of medical progress. The Lancet medical journal is expected to release early stage human trial data Monday on a vaccine developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca.
*****
> # ‘Push and pull’ in market
> Investors also will be watching the market’s own dynamics in the week ahead. There is tension within the market between the bubbly run-up of tech and momentum names on the Nasdaq, and the broader market, or S&P 500, which is basically still flat for the year. The Nasdaq is up 17% year to date, but in the past week lagged other indices, turning in a loss, while the Dow and S&P 500 were both higher.
*****
> The Nasdaq’s outperformance came to an abrupt end Monday, and it has lagged since then. In dramatic fashion, the index rose sharply to new highs, with many big tech names and Tesla also hitting highs. Within the same session, there was a massive reversal in the index and in tech and momentum names, and they closed sharply lower.
*****
> Now strategists are watching to see if the froth will be let out slowly or blow off in a big move that takes the rest of the market with it.
*****
> “We expect the push and pull of the Nasdaq to continue and have sustained volatility, in our view, throughout the earnings season,” said Julian Emanuel, head of equity and derivatives strategy at BTIG. “Volatility could be to the upside, as well as the downside, but in our view, in aggregate, the Nasdaq is likely to correct.”
*****
> Emanuel said the volatile reversal in the Nasdaq does not bode well for the Nasdaq, and it could see a 10% correction. There’s been a surge of retail activity in some of the frothiest names, such as Tesla, which surged from about $1,000 at the end of June to a high of $1,795 during Monday’s session. It is since about $300 per share lower.
*****
> “The combination of public participation and just incredible valuations makes the sector very, very vulnerable. ... It’s the sector with the highest earnings expectations,” said Emanuel. “There’s virtually nothing that management can say at these valuations that’s going to create further upside to these names.”
*****
> Tesla and Microsoft report earnings Wednesday, and Twitter reports Thursday.
*****
> # A bump up in stimulus
> As Congress heads back to Washington in the coming week, expectations are rising that the fiscal stimulus package could be slightly more than Republicans were previously expected to approve.
*****
> When Congress broke for the July 4 holiday, there was a big divide on how much stimulus should be added, on top of the $2.4 trillion already adopted. The Democratic proposal was for $3 trillion, while Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said no more than $1 trillion. Now the gulf has narrowed, but House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the $1.3 trillion under discussions is not enough.
*****
> Cornerstone Macro’s Andy Laperriere said the package could now be $1.5 trillion or more, more than he expected just several weeks ago. He said more money is now expected for state and local governments, local schools, public health, virus testing and payments to support individuals..
*****
> “Republicans really want to use this bill to encourage and incentivize businesses and schools to open. But I think the big thing is a month ago, the top priority of Republicans was to keep this bill small,” he said.
*****
> One of the most controversial elements of the CARES stimulus package was the $600 weekly payment to people who were already collecting unemployment.
*****
> The payment is likely to be significantly reduced and then ultimately phased out, but that will only come after compromise. “There’s going to be some lines-in-the-sand issues, and this is one of them,” said Laperriere, head of policy at Cornerstone.
*****
> President Donald Trump has said he won’t sign the bill unless there is a payroll tax cut, which was previously rejected by Congress. Payroll taxes are paid by both employers and employees, and they fund government programs, including Medicare and Social Security.
*****
> Strategists said the market could react to the deliberations if they take longer than expected, or the funds are viewed as insufficient.
*****
> Michael Schumacher, Wells Fargo director of rate strategy, said the bond market will focus on how quickly the government plans to payout the stimulus and also the degree to which the Treasury will ultimately have to increase auction sizes to pay for it.
*****
> If Congress keeps to its schedule, it needs to approve the package before the end of the month, when it heads to another recess for the entire month of August.

# The Good and the Bad from Earnings This Week

> Earnings season began at the start of this week with Pepsi (PEP) and the first of the major US banks and brokers reporting Q2 numbers. It was a light week with only 32 companies reporting through Thursday, but in the coming weeks, we'll see 100+ reports on multiple trading days.

> From our Earnings Explorer tool, below is a recap of the results from this week's earnings reports. 78% of companies that reported this week beat consensus analyst EPS estimates, while 72% topped consensus sales estimates. Those are both strong numbers. In terms of future projections, 16% of companies raised guidance, and not one company lowered guidance. That's rare even with the very low number of reports so far.

> While guidance and beat rates were strong, investors still used earnings reports as an opportunity to sell. The average one-day share price change this week for companies in reaction to their earnings reports was a decline of 0.57%. All of those declines came on the initial gap down at the open, however. After averaging a gap down of 0.76% at the open of trading following the earnings release, the average stock that reported gained 0.21% from the open to the close. (The gap down of 0.76% and the open to close gain of 0.21% adds up to the full-day decline of 0.57% mentioned earlier.)

> Below is a table showing all 32 companies that reported Q2 numbers this week (through Thursday). The list is sorted by one-day share price reaction from best to worst. Alcoa (AA) had the best price reaction to earnings this week with a gain of 6.39% yesterday. WNS Global (WNS) put up the second-biggest gain at 6.36%. The next best-performing stocks in reaction to earnings this week only gained 3%+ -- USB and HOMB. Other stocks that reported this week that gained in response to their earnings reports include Morgan Stanley (MS), Goldman Sachs (GS), Taiwan Semi (TSM), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), and JP Morgan (JPM).

> On the downside, AngioDynamics (ANGO) saw the worst share price reaction to earnings this week when it fell 11.51% on Thursday. Sleep Number (SNBR) was second-worst with a one-day drop of 9.19% yesterday as well.

> While MS, GS, and JPM all posted gains in reaction to earnings this week, other banks like Citi (C), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Bank of America (BAC) reacted negatively with each falling 4% or more.

# Retail Sales Beat Again

> Retail sales data for June was reported on Thursday, handily beating expectations for the second consecutive month. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, June saw a 7.5% increase month over month, compared with Bloomberg’s consensus expectations for a 5% gain. This comes on the heels of a more than 18% gain in May, but also following by far the lowest reading ever, a 14.7% decline in April.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/7.17.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> Pent-up demand and the continued easing of lockdowns during June likely contributed to the large increase, which saw sales rise across most categories. Sales spiked 8.2% at auto dealers, but even sales excluding autos and gas rose 6.7%. Clothing store sales more than doubled (+105.1%) while sales in the hard-hit food services and drinking places climbed 20%.

> “Consumer spending is still far below pre-pandemic levels and many of the real-time data we are monitoring have begun to level off in the past month,” said LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “We remain encouraged by the strong rebound in May and June, but would expect more gradual gains for retail sales in the second half of the year.”

# Why A Potential Democrat Sweep May Not Be A Market Worry

> Based on the latest polling data, there’s growing consensus that former Vice President Joe Biden potentially may win the election and Democrats possibly may sweep Congress. Some might think this could be a negative for stocks, as a higher corporate tax rate that reduces earnings could be part of the Democratic platform.

> Early writers of the US Constitution were worried about one party having too much power that could enable factions in Washington, DC, to enact more extreme policies and political ideals, upsetting the carefully balanced apple cart. As we noted in our recently released Midyear Outlook 2020, stocks historically have performed quite well when Congress has been split, although stocks actually have done better than most probably realized when the Democrats were in full control.

> “Higher corporate taxes are quite likely should we see a potential Democratic sweep,” said LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But to blindly say stocks will do poorly is quite a stretch, as historically stocks have done rather well under this .”

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&P 500 Index has been higher 9 of the past 10 times and 15 of the past 18 times Democrats controlled both the White House and Congress. Although LPL Research anticipates a likely split Congress in November, with the list of overall worries growing, we don’t think a potential Democratic sweep should be at the top of investors’ list of worries.

# Best of July Likely Over

> NASDAQ’s mid-year rally came to an end on Tuesday, July 14. During the rally’s 12-day stretch beginning on the third to last day of June through the ninth trading day in July, NASDAQ gained 4.7%. This is well above its average performance since 1985 but less than half of its best showing from 1999. At NASDAQ’s high close during the rally on July 10 it was up 6.0%. Historically around this time in July is when the market has begun to weaken as NASDAQ’s full-month average performance is just 0.9% since 1985.

> In the following chart, July’s seasonal pattern over the last 21 years has been plotted with July 2020, plotted on the right axis for comparison through yesterday’s close. This July’s well above average performance so far called for a second, larger range in order to aid in the comparison. Over the last 21 years the market’s trend has been lower beginning right around mid-month through the close. DJIA, S&P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 & 2000 have on average given back some or all of their first half of July gains.

TMO,stocks,Why not create my own equal weighted ETF?,"I have a sizeable enough portfolio, I was thinking why not buy my 40-50 favorite stocks I want to hold for the next ten years in relatively equal proportions?

So why don't I just buy an ETF, you say? I actually used ETFs in my research to pick many of these stocks.

Obviously there are a lot of ETFs with a lot of these stocks in them, but many are top heavy with some of these, or only have about 20-30% max of what they have of these companies total. I don't want a bunch of other stuff I don't care to buy or haven't researched, although I'm sure some are great companies in their own right. Index ETFs also weight based on market cap and I want more of an equal weighting so the smaller companies' growth can shine. In addition to buying only stocks I actually want to hold, I don't have to pay any expense fees to do so while getting the diversification and risk mitigation an ETF offers. 

What about DCAing? My plan is to split my money added every month between, say, the top 3 best performers last month (because growth leads to more growth), the two worst performers overall (lowering cost basis, but analyzing whether to reassess my position), and the top 5 best ""values"" based upon fundamental analysis -- without allowing any one company to exceed like 4% of cost basis. If any company is getting close to 4% of cost basis I move down the list to the next candidate.

With the Excel stocks feature, it's fairly easy to automate a lot of this to track price changes and tell me what I need to buy more of based on stock movement, so I don't think it will be that hard to manage. I may rotate a few of the positions based on changing conditions where I lose faith in the company's future, but I don't want to be too active managing these and with each taking up a relatively small percentage I don't have to overthink it - just like an ETF holder.

Also, I will put the dividend stocks into my non-taxable Roth and low dividend stocks in my taxable account to minimize the annual tax burden and allow for compounding returns.",15,27,1589252422.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/gi2ptt/why_not_create_my_own_equal_weighted_etf/,devilmaskrascal,"Why not create my own equal weighted ETF?

TMO,stocks,LH and why their revenue is in a short term crunch,"This will not be too in depth, but it is something to talk about. I haven't seen this company discussed much but some people will be looking at them since they are one of (if not) the largest lab systems in the world and could be a play due to covid19.

With a plethora of patients not going to doctors offices due to covid19, we will see a short term crunch on their revenue and subsequently their profit.

The logic behind this is that a *massive* portion of the tests the company performs are elective or are not time sensitive.  With this in mind, volume will decline dramatically if it hasn't already.

They took a pretty nasty hit at the start of all of this, but have rebounded a bit. This *could* be a good long term play because once people are able to go to doctor's offices for these tests, their numbers will go up. It will be slow to get back where they were, but it shouldn't take all that long.

Something to consider if you are a ""invest in shovels, pickaxes and buckets, not gold"" type of investor is TMO (the dip proved a good buying opportunity). They produce such a massive percentage of reagent and other important equipment to lab work that they are the sellers of the tools to ""mine the gold"". They also have a deal on the line to purchase Qiagen.

TMO,stocks,Here is a short list for a long-term Corvid-19 testing portfolio. Which stocks are reasonable investments and which are over-hyped?,"Disclaimer: I am currently 100% cash, but plan to start buying essential testing stocks tomorrow. 

There are two general short-term approaches to combating the pandemic, radical isolation with immense economic costs, and extremely thorough testing/screening for infection. It makes sense for the government and individuals to invest capital the testing/screening market. Given that no one knows which companies will be the big winners, it makes sense to start a weighted portfolio that could potentially outperform the major indices. 

Here are my current thoughts:

DHR: A large company that owns Cepheid, which specializes in nucleic acid testing and claims that has been granted FDA approval for a 45-minute test for Corvid-19. On the bright side, DHR has the capital and resources to make a quick test mainstream, and the company has a reasonable P/E of 34 and 0.5% dividend. Also, there is no reason to expect that their nucleic acid testing methods won't work on Corvid-19. On the downside, unless this becomes the standard testing protocol at airports and doctor's offices, the boost to earnings will be mild. Trump didn't explicitly name-drop this company, but I think he was talking about DHR when he mentioned a newly-approved rapid test. 

CODX: This company claims a 2-hour test for Corvid-19, which is slower than DHR's test. On the upside, it is a small company with large potential gains. On the downside, the board has hyped their stock and it has recently experienced significant gains and may be overpriced. 

LH: Labcorp was name-dropped by Trump and Friends and has a good P/E of 13, and will probably receive a cash-infusion from the government. However, the name-dropping only flattened its price crash, and slow testing may quickly go by the wayside in the near future. 

DGX: Quest diagnostics was name-dropped by Trump and has a P/E of 12 with dividends. However, it was flat after the name-drop, hinting at a lack of confidence in their future role in combating the outbreak. 

RHHBY: Roche was name-dropped and stayed flat. This is a large company with a P/E of 21 that may have marginal returns with increased Corvid-19 testing. I probably won't buy it.

TMO: Thermo fisher, with a P/E of 30, was name-dropped by Trump when touting large-scale automated testing. Its price has since declined. TMO is less-prepared for quick-response automated testing. Additionally, I have personally dealt with this company in the past and I consider it a poor stepchild to Agilent, which has far better test equipment and software that is available at a modestly higher price. I don't know why the Trump administration is touting an agreement with Thermo Fisher over Agilent. I probably won't buy it. 

Please make any other suggestions regarding major players in the testing market. I'm very comfortable with losing money on the majority of the portfolio, but I don't want to miss the big winners.",2,7,1584922633.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/fnacxj/here_is_a_short_list_for_a_longterm_corvid19/,Fauster,"Here is a short list for a long-term Corvid-19 testing portfolio.

There are 64 more trading days left between now and expiration, IV is at 107%, 8-9% short position relative to float. Currently nvda holds a 7% stake in coreweave and a strategic partnership, which was partially responsible for the run up. Below is a summary of the partnership from nvda:

“The general availability of NVIDIA GB200 NVL72-based instances on CoreWeave underscores the latest in the companies’ collaboration, focused on delivering the latest accelerated computing solutions to the cloud. With the launch of these instances, enterprises now have access to the scale and performance needed to power the next wave of AI reasoning models and agents.

Coreweave owns data centers in the US and Canada including the fastest super computer in the world that is powered by nvda chips. The strategic partnership (as well as ownership stake) gives coreweave dibs on the latest nvda chips, which gives coreweave a leg up over its competitors. In addition to Nvda, Microsoft is another major client. It is my opinion that we are just at the beginning of an AI arms race, coreweave is in a fantastic position to reap  the benefits from money from both private and public sectors indiscriminately flowing into anything related to AI. 

Biggest concerns include 1) 325% 3 months run making coreweave susceptible to major pull back, and 2) geopolitical tensions and tariff wars may tank the market. 

However, the concerns are short term, and are alleviated by the large premium (my break even is $87.94), the stock would need to drop almost 50% from Wednesday close for me to incur a loss. Worst case scenario, I am forced to buy 3,100 shares at a loss, I will sell covered calls and wheel my way to profitability.

Here’s why:

* Cloudflare isn’t just a CDN or DDoS shield — it’s becoming the backbone of the internet
* They’re rolling out serverless compute (Workers), AI inference at the edge, and building a network that can scale globally faster and cheaper than the cloud giants.
* AI workloads need fast, secure, distributed infra — exactly what Cloudflare specializes in.
* Partnerships with OpenAI, Hugging Face, NVIDIA, etc., are flying under the radar.

NVDA,wallstreetbets,$APLD: This ain’t a stock. It’s a launchpad. Public Pureplay on the AI Bottleneck.,"I’m long APLD.

Applied Digital is a developer of next-generation infrastructure for AI. They have two segments: (i) custom-built, high-performance data centers; and (ii) GPUs as a service. Applied is currently focused on a large 400MW data center project in Ellendale, ND, and is marketing a 1.4GW pipeline of additional capacity. Please see the company’s latest investor presentation on their website for more details. 

There is a frenzy for compute power by both hyperscalers and Fortune 500 companies, covered extensively everywhere you look. Power and datacenter capacity is the new bottleneck. Nvidia’s CEO, Jensen, has and continues to discuss the need to modernize a trillion dollars worth of data centers to tap into AI’s potential. APLD is a first mover aiming to capture this opportunity.

APLD’s history in developing power hungry crypto hosting sites in low-cost power locations was the perfect preparation for today’s AI opportunity. APLD’s foray into North Dakota for cheap electricity to fund crypto mining left the company with relationships and access to massive low cost power, low cost land with space for expansion, room for additional wind/solar farms to be integrated, state tax incentives, and cooler temperatures which are beneficial for the TCO of high density AI data centers. A healthy dose of luck contributed to locking up this opportunity, industry participants have told me you cannot underscore just how valuable this power and first mover advantage is for prospective customers. If GPUs are the pickaxes behind the AI revolution, power guys are swinging the axes.

**Unit Economics and Valuation**

**HPC Data Centers**
The rule of thumb for data centers is it costs $8-12 million per MW to build and each MW can generate ~$1mm of NOI. Applied Digital’s Ellendale campus has signed 250 MW of 15-year leases with CoreWeave, expected to generate $7 billion of total revenue over those 15 years (≈$466.7 million per year). That works out to ≈$1.867 million of revenue per MW per year. Assuming a typical HPC/data center EBITDA margin of 50–60 %, each MW will likely produce $0.9–$1.2 million of NOI per year. Therefore, the 250 MW currently under contract should yield $233–$280 million of NOI annually. At a 5–6 % cap rate, that implies an enterprise value (TEV) in the $3.9–$5.6 billion range for the signed 250 MW. If the full 400 MW build is leased at similar economics, total NOI would be $360–$480 million per year, implying TEV of $6–$9.6 billion. The remaining 150 MW of backlog could contribute up to $150 million of additional annual NOI—i.e., another $2.5–$3 billion of TEV—if signed at comparable rates. 

Locking in the 250 MW CoreWeave lease translates into roughly $3.3–$5.17b of equity, or about $15–$23 per share. Each additional 100 MW of backlog, using $0.9–$1.2 m of NOI per MW and a 5–6 % cap rate, would be worth approximately $5/share using the same math. If Applied is able to lock in 1.4GW of projects, that’s an additional $70/share of value that could be created. Haircut all of this however you prefer. The numbers can get wild.

**Applied Digital Cloud**
This segment has not been a focus for the company or the investment community recently, but is an underappreciated lotto ticket. Think of it as an early-stage CoreWeave. The business model is simple: they purchase GPUs from NVDA, install them in data centers, and lease them to customers for a fixed contract term that is typically 2-3 years. The GPUs typically pay for themselves during the initial lease term, leaving Applied Digital Cloud owning them free and clear at the end of the lease term for several more years of use. Applied takes very little risk here because at the time they purchase the GPUs there is already a contract in place for a full pay back of the equipment.

The NVDA investment is especially important for this segment because this is where NVDA can drive Applied’s future success. The hyperscalers are working on their own chips and are frienemies, so it is in NVDA’s long-term interest to ensure that there is a healthy ecosystem to support the consumption of their GPUs. They want companies like Applied and CoreWeave to prosper. NVDA can assure Applied’s success in a variety of ways by providing: (i) early allocations of the latest products; (ii) the best customer prospects who want to consume NVDA’s products as a service; and (iii) capital.

Consider what NVDA’s support did for CoreWeave. NVDA invested $100MM in CoreWeave in 2023 at a $2BN valuation. As of September 2024 CoreWeave was raising money at a $23BN valuation…. And look at where they are now. 

Valuing this segment is tricky because it is just getting started. If we assume it’s worth just 10% of CoreWeave, that’s $7BN. And it goes up from there. In the fullness of time, if Applied Digital Cloud prospers, then the company will spin this out as a separate company.   

**The High Level Setup**
Based on the recently announced data center lease with CoreWeave, it is clear that APLD is the real deal and has a chance to be a leader in the next gen data center buildout. BUT despite the recent surge in stock price, it has yet to go from zero to hero with the stock price still being vastly under valued.
 
Applied Digital will be the only pure play next-gen data center player in the public markets. There is no short thesis when NVDA and Related are anchor investors and a hyperscaler is a long-term partner and customer. APLD will fundamentally be worth a lot more than current prices, the stock should disconnect from any fundamental grounding as a result of being a public pureplay on the next AI bottleneck. The right tail asymmetry of this investment is under appreciated.  

**TLDR:** Company that used to mine magic internet money accidentally built a gold mine for AI. Now NVDA’s homies are renting it out, and the GPU gods might bless them with infinite tendies. Bags secured, brain not required

Applied Digital is a developer of next-generation infrastructure for AI. They have two segments: (i) custom-built, high-performance data centers; and (ii) GPUs as a service. Applied is currently focused on a large 400MW data center project in Ellendale, ND, and is marketing a 1.4GW pipeline of additional capacity. Please see the company’s latest investor presentation on their website for more details. 

There is a frenzy for compute power by both hyperscalers and Fortune 500 companies, covered extensively everywhere you look. Power and datacenter capacity is the new bottleneck. Nvidia’s CEO, Jensen, has and continues to discuss the need to modernize a trillion dollars worth of data centers to tap into AI’s potential. APLD is a first mover aiming to capture this opportunity.

APLD’s history in developing power hungry crypto hosting sites in low-cost power locations was the perfect preparation for today’s AI opportunity. APLD’s foray into North Dakota for cheap electricity to fund crypto mining left the company with relationships and access to massive low cost power, low cost land with space for expansion, room for additional wind/solar farms to be integrated, state tax incentives, and cooler temperatures which are beneficial for the TCO of high density AI data centers. A healthy dose of luck contributed to locking up this opportunity, industry participants have told me you cannot underscore just how valuable this power and first mover advantage is for prospective customers. If GPUs are the pickaxes behind the AI revolution, power guys are swinging the axes.

**Unit Economics and Valuation**

**HPC Data Centers**
The rule of thumb for data centers is it costs $8-12 million per MW to build and each MW can generate ~$1mm of NOI. Applied Digital’s Ellendale campus has signed 250 MW of 15-year leases with CoreWeave, expected to generate $7 billion of total revenue over those 15 years (≈$466.7 million per year). That works out to ≈$1.867 million of revenue per MW per year. Assuming a typical HPC/data center EBITDA margin of 50–60 %, each MW will likely produce $0.9–$1.2 million of NOI per year. Therefore, the 250 MW currently under contract should yield $233–$280 million of NOI annually. At a 5–6 % cap rate, that implies an enterprise value (TEV) in the $3.9–$5.6 billion range for the signed 250 MW. If the full 400 MW build is leased at similar economics, total NOI would be $360–$480 million per year, implying TEV of $6–$9.6 billion. The remaining 150 MW of backlog could contribute up to $150 million of additional annual NOI—i.e., another $2.5–$3 billion of TEV—if signed at comparable rates. 

Locking in the 250 MW CoreWeave lease translates into roughly $3.3–$5.17b of equity, or about $15–$23 per share. Each additional 100 MW of backlog, using $0.9–$1.2 m of NOI per MW and a 5–6 % cap rate, would be worth approximately $5/share using the same math. If Applied is able to lock in 1.4GW of projects, that’s an additional $70/share of value that could be created. Haircut all of this however you prefer. The numbers can get wild.

**Applied Digital Cloud**
This segment has not been a focus for the company or the investment community recently, but is an underappreciated lotto ticket. Think of it as an early-stage CoreWeave. The business model is simple: they purchase GPUs from NVDA, install them in data centers, and lease them to customers for a fixed contract term that is typically 2-3 years. The GPUs typically pay for themselves during the initial lease term, leaving Applied Digital Cloud owning them free and clear at the end of the lease term for several more years of use. Applied takes very little risk here because at the time they purchase the GPUs there is already a contract in place for a full pay back of the equipment.

The NVDA investment is especially important for this segment because this is where NVDA can drive Applied’s future success. The hyperscalers are working on their own chips and are frienemies, so it is in NVDA’s long-term interest to ensure that there is a healthy ecosystem to support the consumption of their GPUs. They want companies like Applied and CoreWeave to prosper. NVDA can assure Applied’s success in a variety of ways by providing: (i) early allocations of the latest products; (ii) the best customer prospects who want to consume NVDA’s products as a service; and (iii) capital.

Consider what NVDA’s support did for CoreWeave. NVDA invested $100MM in CoreWeave in 2023 at a $2BN valuation. As of September 2024 CoreWeave was raising money at a $23BN valuation…. And look at where they are now. 

Valuing this segment is tricky because it is just getting started. If we assume it’s worth just 10% of CoreWeave, that’s $7BN. And it goes up from there. In the fullness of time, if Applied Digital Cloud prospers, then the company will spin this out as a separate company.   

**The High Level Setup**
Based on the recently announced data center lease with CoreWeave, it is clear that APLD is the real deal and has a chance to be a leader in the next gen data center buildout. BUT despite the recent surge in stock price, it has yet to go from zero to hero with the stock price still being vastly under valued.
 
Applied Digital will be the only pure play next-gen data center player in the public markets. There is no short thesis when NVDA and Related are anchor investors and a hyperscaler is a long-term partner and customer. APLD will fundamentally be worth a lot more than current prices, the stock should disconnect from any fundamental grounding as a result of being a public pureplay on the next AI bottleneck. The right tail asymmetry of this investment is under appreciated.

**Jobs Report Comes As Fed Faces Pressure on Interest Rates**  
The scheduled Friday release of the May U.S. jobs report will show whether the labor market continues to exhibit strength after employers added more jobs than analysts expected in April, as the unemployment rate remained at 4.2%.

Trump has been applying pressure on the Fed to cut interest rates from their current levels of 4.25% to 4.5%. Fed officials have said that they are in “wait-and-see” mode as the labor market remains strong and inflation comes under pressure from U.S. tariffs.

Earlier in the week, market watchers will get updates on job openings, private-sector payrolls, and weekly jobless claims.

Several Fed officials are scheduled to speak, including Federal Reserve Chair Powell, Dallas Fed President Logan, Chicago Fed President Goolsbee, and Philadelphia Fed President Harker. On Wednesday, the Fed’s Beige Book will provide more details on economic conditions throughout the country.

The Thursday scheduled report on the U.S. trade deficit comes as tariff threats have pushed shippers to increase imports ahead of the expected import taxes.

Investors will also be watching manufacturing and services industry surveys scheduled for release this week, as well as updated data on consumer credit levels, factory orders, and construction spending.

**Tech, Retail Earnings Reports in Focus**  
Chipmaker Broadcom’s scheduled financial report, due Thursday, comes on the heels of industry leader Nvidia’s (NVDA) report last week that showed continued demand for artificial intelligence (AI) products. Broadcom reported a 77% jump in its AI-related revenue in its most recent financial release as company executives forecast continued growth in that sector.

Cybersecurity company CrowdStrike Holdings is expected to release its earnings on Tuesday. The firm said in early May that it planned to cut 5% of its workforce. Guidewire Software, which provides services to insurance providers, is also expected to deliver an update on its AI products Tuesday.

Logistics software provider Descartes Systems Group is expected to release its earnings on Wednesday. Shippers continue to grapple with the impact of Trump's tariffs on the supply chain.

With consumer sentiment surveys showing increasing concerns over economic conditions, investors will be watching reports from retailers for signals on spending. Scheduled reports from Dollar General on Tuesday and Dollar Tree and Five Below on Wednesday will provide a look at consumer traffic at those stores. Campbell’s scheduled report on Monday will shine a light on food spending, while fashion brands Lululemon and Calvin Klein parent PVH also will be reporting.

Back when ChatGPT launched, Nvidia had a market cap of just over $400 billion. It's now over $3.3 trillion. Over that same time period, chip competitor Intel's ([INTC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/INTC)) market cap has actually decreased, while Advanced Micro Devices' ([AMD](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMD)) market cap has increased incrementally from $125 billion to $177 billion.Nvidia's rise proved to be at the center of a new technological boom.

From the company's fourth quarter of 2023 to its final quarter of its 2025 reporting period, data center revenue grew almost 900%.

Nvidia's data center revenue particularly stands out when considering its rise against peers in the industry. In the final quarter of 2024, Nvidia notched a record $35.58 billion in just data center revenue, up from $3.62 billion in the final quarter of 2022.

At the beginning of April, the analyst consensus for NVDA’s Q1 EPS was an average of $0.93 per share, up from $0.89 in Q4. NVDA’s EPS has increased QoQ since 2022, when both Q2 and Q3 EPS were $0.03, down from $0.06 in Q1. The image below shows the trend and revisions for analysts’ EPS estimates this quarter.

https://preview.redd.it/2cew4jyvet2f1.png?width=1046&format=png&auto=webp&s=9583d6f1ac0e6d4f870e6da9b8329198681e3e99

The current average estimate is around $0.73 within a week of the release. **That is a decrease of over 20% from the previous consensus, and calls for NVDA’s first decline in EPS QoQ since 2022.** So what’s causing this massive shift in expectations?

People will quickly cite the $5.5 billion charge “for inventory, purchase commitments, and related reserves” as the reason for such a drop, **which is completely wrong.**

The charge will almost certainly be listed as a GAAP Non-Operating Expense, meaning that the Non-GAAP expense segments should be minimally impacted. Headlines report the non-GAAP EPS number, meaning the downward revisions have more to do with the indirect impacts of the China export ban and other trade controls, rather than the direct $5.5 billion charge.

A deeper look into the estimates will show that data center revenue and data center margin have seen the most significant negative revisions. The revisions come in response to the H20 ban, which resulted in a loss of 2 weeks of sales in China, and changed the product mix as a % of sales in the quarter.

These are two negative impacts on profitability, with sales and margin on those sales both seeing steep declines. However, it appears analysts may be overestimating how much revenue was lost from those two weeks in China, and may have completely misunderstood how margins will be impacted entirely.

According to Business Daily, China sales represented 13% of NVDA’s revenue last year, and the share of sales in China has been trending down. Since 2 weeks of a 13 week quarter is about 15% of the total time, and about 13% of revenue from that two weeks is gone, basic math tells us Data Center Revenue should decrease by roughly 2%.

My initial estimate was $41.0 billion, and decreasing it by 2% would amount to about $40.2 billion. Analyst consensus is sitting around $38.5 billion according to Nasdaq(dot)com, an increase of only 8.1% QoQ. Below is a graph of Data Center Revenue for the past 11 quarters, shown in blue, with the red point being analyst estimates for the current quarter.

[The Consensus is a massive slowdown this quarter](https://preview.redd.it/2rosyfazet2f1.png?width=1967&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4715f993863c35850b5e96c315e0c5a05e12a7d)

As for the impact on gross margin, analysts have revised their estimates down due to the shift in product mix without the H20 chips and other China products.

According to Yahoo Finance, H20 chips were estimated in the 50% range for margins, and their recent strength actually put downward pressure on margins. This means it is unlikely that the new product mix has a significantly lower margin than pre-H20 ban.

The company-issued guidance for gross margin in the current quarter is 71%, with the average analyst now expecting 68.4% according to CMC Markets.

Since the total revenue average estimate is $43.1 billion, and $38.5 billion is data center revenue, we know the other three segments are estimated to contribute $4.6 billion to total revenue.

I estimate $4.2 billion from the remaining segments, but a higher gross margin using 71% from company-issued guidance.

So, how much distance is between my estimates and the analysts’ estimates? Well, analysts are currently expecting $43.1 billion in revenue and 68.4% gross margin, while I anticipate at least $44.3 billion and 71% margins. The product of those numbers is the profit before subtracting Operating and Non-Operating Expenses, and dividing by shares outstanding.

**I have $31.453 billion, while the analyst consensus is $29.48 billion, which is almost $2 billion lower.**

Even if expenses come in higher than the company-issued guidance, analysts have sandbagged expectations going into the print. I expect a massive “surprise” beat on earnings day.

**Most importantly, a large beat still may not be priced in, even after the pre-earnings rally. The stock is still around the same price it was going into last quarter’s print. If we see QoQ earnings growth beating estimates, I believe investors will take the stock higher, while if this is all a pipe dream and earnings do decline, we could stay rangebound or worse.** 

**As always, this is for educational purposes only and should not be taken as financial advice.** ",34,17,1748129763.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1kuoxss/with_clear_positions_analysts_expect_first_eps/,hazxrrd,"[With Clear Positions] Analysts Expect First EPS Drop Since 2022!?

My initial estimate was $41.0 billion, and decreasing it by 2% would amount to about $40.2 billion. Analyst consensus is sitting around $38.5 billion according to Nasdaq(dot)com, an increase of only 8.1% QoQ. Below is a graph of Data Center Revenue for the past 11 quarters, shown in blue, with the red point being analyst estimates for the current quarter.

[The Consensus is a massive slowdown this quarter](https://preview.redd.it/2rosyfazet2f1.png?width=1967&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4715f993863c35850b5e96c315e0c5a05e12a7d)

As for the impact on gross margin, analysts have revised their estimates down due to the shift in product mix without the H20 chips and other China products.

According to Yahoo Finance, H20 chips were estimated in the 50% range for margins, and their recent strength actually put downward pressure on margins. This means it is unlikely that the new product mix has a significantly lower margin than pre-H20 ban.

The company-issued guidance for gross margin in the current quarter is 71%, with the average analyst now expecting 68.4% according to CMC Markets.

Since the total revenue average estimate is $43.1 billion, and $38.5 billion is data center revenue, we know the other three segments are estimated to contribute $4.6 billion to total revenue.

I estimate $4.2 billion from the remaining segments, but a higher gross margin using 71% from company-issued guidance.

So, how much distance is between my estimates and the analysts’ estimates? Well, analysts are currently expecting $43.1 billion in revenue and 68.4% gross margin, while I anticipate at least $44.3 billion and 71% margins. The product of those numbers is the profit before subtracting Operating and Non-Operating Expenses, and dividing by shares outstanding.

**I have $31.453 billion, while the analyst consensus is $29.48 billion, which is almost $2 billion lower.**

Even if expenses come in higher than the company-issued guidance, analysts have sandbagged expectations going into the print. I expect a massive “surprise” beat on earnings day.

**Most importantly, a large beat still may not be priced in, even after the pre-earnings rally. The stock is still around the same price it was going into last quarter’s print. If we see QoQ earnings growth beating estimates, I believe investors will take the stock higher, while if this is all a pipe dream and earnings do decline, we could stay rangebound or worse.** 

**As always, this is for educational purposes only and should not be taken as financial advice.** ",-0.5068,Negative

(Bloomberg) — The Trump administration will maintain efforts to keep advanced artificial intelligence technology out of China’s hands, a top White House official said, brushing off calls from Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang to ease restrictions on chip exports to the world’s second largest economy.

“We obviously have huge respect for Jensen,” Sriram Krishnan, White House senior policy adviser for artificial intelligence, said in a Bloomberg Television interview Wednesday. “When it comes to inside China, I do think there is still bipartisan and broad concern about what can happen to these GPUs once they’re physically inside” the country, he added.

While the Trump administration still sees a security risk from widening AI chip exports to China, Krishnan said it agrees with Huang’s view that restrictions on a wide range of other US trading partners need to be revisited. The Trump administration is rescinding and moving to replace the Biden-era AI diffusion rule that Krishnan said created “GPU haves and GPU have nots.”

“When it comes to the rest of the world, we want American AI stack starting from the GPUs to the models to everything on top,” Krishnan said. “On that, Jensen and I and us are in agreement.”

Krishnan spoke hours after Huang made his most forceful public comments to date against escalating US export restrictions aimed at China. Speaking at the Computex industry conference in Taipei, Huang blasted the measures as a “failure” and urged the US to lower barriers to chip sales in China before American firms cede the market to rivals such as Huawei Technologies Co.

Huang told reporters that China will account for a $50 billion opportunity in 2026. “China has 50% of the world’s AI developers, and it’s important that when they develop on an architecture, they develop on Nvidia, or at least American technology,” he said. Nvidia recently wrote off $5.5 billion in H20 AI chips that had been designed to comply with previous export curbs, but were targeted by a new round of restrictions from the Trump administration this year.

Krishnan pointed to the flurry of projects in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates announced by American companies during President Donald Trump’s trip to the Middle East last week as evidence of a new effort to ease US allies’ access to AI. He stressed that the agreements would still contain security restrictions to prevent the illegal transfer of advanced technology to China and other adversaries.

“These deals and these GPUs are predominantly going to be run by American hyperscalers, American cloud service providers and American companies,” said Krishnan, who was a general partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz prior to joining the White House. “Most of these GPUs are going to be run, hosted, controlled by American companies.”",68,50,1747855124.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ks6hod/us_to_keep_china_chip_curbs_spurning_nvidias_call/,callsonreddit,"US to keep China chip curbs, spurning Nvidia’s call for relief No paywall: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-keep-china-chip-curbs-170252299.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-keep-china-chip-curbs-170252299.html)

2. Uber is investing 100 million into the company, and they just recently delivered the first driverless robotaxi rides in the Middle East. WeRide also collaborating extensively with UAE government.
3. Manufacturing costs substantially lower than Waymo - this is perhaps the key advantage of robotaxi stocks who collaborates with Chinese auto firms. Waymo is currently seeking partnerships with Zeekr, which means that WeRide is one step ahead.
4. Pony AI was originally 3x their market cap, despite arguably worst products - especially in terms of overall safety record. WeRide has had 0 incidents to date.
5. WeRide possess regulatory permits for 5 countries: France, China, UAE, Singapore, and the US. Global expansion far faster than peers. More are on the way - e.g. Switzerland.
6. Strategic collaboration with Tencent, with future incorporation into Tencent's super app WeChat. This will help broaden WeRide's reach, while also providing WeRide with ample cloud resources.
7. Listing on the Hong Kong stock exchange is likely coming this year. Given how well IPOs have done (e.g. CATL) on there this year and WeRide's cheap valuation, one can expect a significant boost to the stock.
8. CEO and CTO are both highly competent, who helped pioneer the industry in China at Baidu.

Huang’s keynote, which will be livestreamed from Taipei’s Music Center at 11 p.m. ET Sunday, is expected to highlight Nvidia’s latest advances, and may bring announcements of new partnerships.

Shares of the AI chipmaker’s stock were little changed Friday.

At last year’s Computex, Nvidia had announced the successor to its Blackwell AI chip, known as Rubin, sending shares higher. Huang in March said Rubin is still set to launch in 2026.

""We would expect relatively positive news on the AI front out of Computex next week,"" Wedbush analysts told clients in a note Friday.

NVDA,wallstreetbets,"This market is disgustingly overpriced, and we are due for a correction similar to what we saw during Dot Com/Global financial crisis.","I want to preface this by stating that I legitimately home someone can refute what I have to say here. I take no pleasure in the thought of people's 401k's and IRA's and pension funds getting absolutely decimated, and this post has nothing to do with politics... I think the market has been overpriced for a long time (+/- 8 years), and it is only getting worse.

**Some quick points:**

**1. Price to earnings ratio**

Price to earnings ratio is at the point of absolute lunacy. The S&P 500 is over 28 today, and before the market started correcting in February, we were actually over 31. The Nasdaq is at 37 and was as high as 44. While I imagine most in this subreddit at least have a grasp of what P/E means -- for those that don't -- here's a quick summary. For purposes of this post, let's use NVDA as an example. Assume NVDA didn't have a single penny in expenses. They didn't have to pay for employees. They had no rent. There was no salary for Jensen Huang, and they didn't have to pay a penny in taxes. They somehow got all their electricity for free, and they didn't even have a COGS (cost of goods sold) -- somehow they were getting all of their materials for free. Then also assume that their sales remained exactly where they are at today... that their revenue remained identical to where it is at today, and they took 100% of that revenue, and distributed it back among the shareholders of the company. Right now -- NVDA's P/E is at 45.43 -- meaning it would be 45 years before investors recouped their money.

The entire S&P is trading over 28 today... meaning if the +/- 500 largest companies in the USA didn't have a single expense, and continued generating the same revenue, it would take 28 years for investors to get their money back.

Who in the world would be interested in signing up for that ""investment"" opportunity? My own mother could call me asking me to invest in her company and I wouldn't invest based on that return.

**2. The Buffett indicator**

The Buffett indicator is a simple calculation of the total value of the US stock market divided by GDP.

Historically, that number has hung out right around 1-- meaning the total value of the US stock market should be roughly the same as GDP. Buffett himself stated a value of 75-90% is reasonable, and a value over 120% signals the market is overpriced. The highest the buffett indicator has ever hit was during the dot com bubble, when it was 2.1 standard deviations above the trendline. The highest until now, that is. The market value is currently 211% of GDP, or almost 70% above what historically has been seen as normal.

**3. The stock market is insanely top heavy.**

The Mag 7 currently account for 31% of the S&P 500, and over 40% of the Nasdaq. If these 7 stocks correct, it would be absolutely catastrophic for the market as a whole. We saw this play out during Dot Com with the likes of Cisco, Intel, and Oracle. While the market was top heavy then -- it was nowhere near as top heavy as it is today... In fact -- the top 10 most valuable companies now represent more than twice as much of a percentage of value in the market as the top 10 did when Dot Com crashed.

Side note -- but I do think investors have briefly taken note of this. So much of these companies is based on perceived future growth based on revenue that can/will be generated by AI. But remember what happened when DeepSeek emerged last year -- and alerted WallStreet that an incredibly sophisticated AI can be created without pouring billions of dollars into R&D and infrastructure? The market absolutely tanked. What if it becomes obvious that these AI plays will not be unique to the largest tech companies in the world, and that these systems can be developed by any mid-cap with a decent budget?

**4. Home prices and the Housing Market**

I won't dive too deep into this, but homes are more unaffordable today than at any point in US history. Based on median US income and Median US home price, right before the Global financial crisis/mortgage crisis of 08/09 -- this number hit it's highest point in US history -- 45%.

Its highest percent *until* the last 12 months. It now takes over 46% of a family's income to purchase a home.  
30% is the figure that is generally regarded as affordable.

The condo market is collapsing, particularly in Florida, where HOA dues and Insurance costs have made these properties completely unaffordable.

Foreclosures on FHA loans are also set to resume. Biden put in place a policy where anyone that wanted could simply apply for a mortgage payment deferment after COVID... meaning call your servicer, say you're experiencing a hardship, and they simply give you a deferral. None of these homes could be foreclosed upon. They then tack these payments on to the back end of the loan with the additional accrued interest. This policy still exists today, but is about to come to an end in September. As of Q1 2025, over 10.6% of all FHA mortgages are at least one payment late. Over 4% of FHA mortgages are over 90 days late.

What happens when FHA foreclosures absolutely flood the market?

What does this do to home prices, and even more importantly, what does this do to homebuilders? If inventory skyrockets (more than it already has over the last couple of months), and price pressure pushes everything down due to increased supply, will home builders still be able to make money? Homebuilding employs over 11 million americans... Plumbers, electricians, roofers, landscapers, drywallers, framers, truck drivers, etc --

When homes stop being built, unemployment skyrockets, and GDP shrinks dramatically.

**5. Consumer debt is through the roof**

Credit card debt is at the highest it's ever been, and delinquency rates are as high as they've been since emerging from the global financial crisis. Q4 of 2011 was the last time delinquency rates were this high.

Auto loan delinquency rates are the highest they've been in decades.

**6. Bonds -- worldwide -- are pushing higher and higher.**

The US is getting hit here worse than most, as it seems people are not excited about Trump's game of chicken with tariffs. Nonetheless -- you are seeing bond yields push higher and higher worldwide, as investors demand higher returns for government bonds to account for their perceived risk. Interest rates cuts have not quelled this. Despite 100bps cuts in the federal funds rate since last year, the 10 year t-note is actually up 80 ticks since then.

**7. Commercial real estate**

A massive amount of commercial real-estate will need to be refinanced in the coming 12-24 months -- and you will see these payments skyrocket. Many holders of Commercial real-estate refinanced their properties in the quarters after COVID, when interest rates were incredibly low. Most of these loans are either done on 5-year balloons, or as adjustable rate mortgages. These owners will see their payments jump by 30,50, even 70% as they are forced to refinance these properties and interest rates that are close to double what they were last time. This will be compounded by the fact that many companies moved to work from home models, or at least partial work from home models. Office space vacancy rates have skyrocketed -- meaning less tenants -- all while mortgage payments on these properties is skyrocketing.

**8. Student Loan Debt**

The government's moratorium on student loan payments has officially come to an end. 43 million Americans that have been been able to avoid making payments on their average of $38k in student loan debt for the last 5+ years are now going to have to start making payments. Those that don't will see their credit score be absolutely decimated. What other payments will the begin to fall behind on? As I mentioned previously -- credit card delinquency rates and auto loan delinquency rates are already high -- and rising. How much worse does that get when 15% of the population beings adding a several hundred dollar payment to their expenses each month?

There is a dozen other items I could list here, but in the interest of actually getting some work done today, I'll leave my post there.

I would genuinely love for someone to refute places I'm missing the mark, or why I may be wrong about my assumptions above.

NVDA,wallstreetbets,Everything about AMD's earnings tonight,"Okay guys, AMD will report its first quarter earnings after the bell on Tuesday. What are we gonna do? See, I'm the concern about the impact of Trump’s tariffs on chip sales and the health of the AI market ahead of Nvidia’s (NVDA) earnings later this month.

For those who have been paying attention, AMD’s announcement follows rival Intel’s (INTC) report, which saw the company beat on the top and bottom lines but issue lighter-than-anticipated revenue guidance in the second quarter. At the time, Intel CFO David Zinsner blamed the “current macro environment” for creating “elevated uncertainty across the industry.”

PC makers produce a number of their products in China, as well as Vietnam and Malaysia. Computers are currently exempt from Trump’s tariffs, but the administration has said it could implement duties on semiconductors based on the results of the Commerce Department’s Section 232 investigation.

For the quarter, AMD is expected to report adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.94 on revenue of $7.1 billion. The company saw EPS of $0.62 and revenue of $5.4 billion in the same quarter last year. Data Center segment revenue is expected to bring in $3.6 billion in the quarter compared to $2.3 billion last year.

In April, AMD, like Nvidia, announced that the Trump administration instituted tighter export controls on AI chips destined for China. The move effectively cuts off AMD’s ability to ship its MI308 AI processor to the region, and, according to the company, might result in as much as an $800 million charge on inventory, purchase commitments, and related reserves. And that could weigh on the company’s Q2 outlook.

I expect AMD to post higher results but guide lower given 1Q strength for MI308. Longer term, this might be a good thing in 2Q with the AI chip ban into China.

For those following AI stocks, you may have noticed them taking a major hit over the past few months on fears that the trade has been overhyped. DeepSeek’s January announcement that it managed to produce high-performance AI models using less than top-of-the-line chips further hammered chip stocks.

Shares of AMD are off 18% year to date and 36% over the last 12 months. Nvidia is down 15% year to date, but still up 22% over the last year.

Unfortunately for AMD the AI story (which is already somewhat tenuous) is likely to drop further on the back of new China sanctions. 

[Chart](https://i.imgur.com/4PdTT1Q.png)

AI chip companies with to deal with the government's AI diffusion rules, which would require certain countries to acquire special licenses to gain access to a limited number of US AI chips.

AMD’s Client segment, which includes revenue from the sale of laptop and desktop chips, is expected to generate $2 billion in revenue, up from $1.3 billion in Q1 last year. There’s the potential that the company could report that it saw a pull forward in sales leading up to Trump’s April 2 tariff announcements.

From what I've read, the core PC business appears to be exposed to channel effects (client shipments last quarter were higher than the peak of the COVID bubble already).

AMD’s gaming business, which includes sales of GPUs and semi-custom chips for video game consoles, is expected to bring in $540 million, a 41% year-over-year decline from the same quarter last year. It's only recently that the Ryzen biz has pivoted from hardcore HPC parts, such as the Instinct MI250-series used in the United States' first exascale supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, to parts competitive with Nvidia for lower-precision AI applications. When it launched, the MI300X boasted up to 32 percent higher performance in certain AI workloads compared to Nvidia's then-flagship the H100, along with more than double the memory and significantly greater bandwidth. 

Sony's (SONY) and Microsoft’s (MSFT) consoles are approaching the second half of their life cycles, which generally means sales slide versus when they initially hit the market. Companies are also raising prices on the systems to contend with tariffs. Sony has increased the price of its PlayStation in Europe, but not in the US. Consoles aren’t exempt from duties like laptops and desktops. As a result, Microsoft announced it is raising the price of its Xbox Series X by $100 to $599. The company also said it’s raising the price of some of its first-party games to $79 from $69.

The move effectively cuts off AMD’s ability to ship its MI308 AI processor to the region, and, according to the company, might result in as much as an $800 million charge on inventory, purchase commitments, and related reserves. And that could weigh on the company’s Q2 outlook.

I expect AMD to post higher results but guide lower given 1Q strength for MI308. Longer term, this might be a good thing in 2Q with the AI chip ban into China.

For those following AI stocks, you may have noticed them taking a major hit over the past few months on fears that the trade has been overhyped. DeepSeek’s January announcement that it managed to produce high-performance AI models using less than top-of-the-line chips further hammered chip stocks.

Shares of AMD are off 18% year to date and 36% over the last 12 months. Nvidia is down 15% year to date, but still up 22% over the last year.

Unfortunately for AMD the AI story (which is already somewhat tenuous) is likely to drop further on the back of new China sanctions.

AI chip companies with to deal with the government's AI diffusion rules, which would require certain countries to acquire special licenses to gain access to a limited number of US AI chips.

AMD’s Client segment, which includes revenue from the sale of laptop and desktop chips, is expected to generate $2 billion in revenue, up from $1.3 billion in Q1 last year. There’s the potential that the company could report that it saw a pull forward in sales leading up to Trump’s April 2 tariff announcements.

From what I've read, the core PC business appears to be exposed to channel effects (client shipments last quarter were higher than the peak of the COVID bubble already).

AMD’s gaming business, which includes sales of GPUs and semi-custom chips for video game consoles, is expected to bring in $540 million, a 41% year-over-year decline from the same quarter last year. It's only recently that the Ryzen biz has pivoted from hardcore HPC parts, such as the Instinct MI250-series used in the United States' first exascale supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, to parts competitive with Nvidia for lower-precision AI applications. When it launched, the MI300X boasted up to 32 percent higher performance in certain AI workloads compared to Nvidia's then-flagship the H100, along with more than double the memory and significantly greater bandwidth. 

Sony's (SONY) and Microsoft’s (MSFT) consoles are approaching the second half of their life cycles, which generally means sales slide versus when they initially hit the market. Companies are also raising prices on the systems to contend with tariffs. Sony has increased the price of its PlayStation in Europe, but not in the US. Consoles aren’t exempt from duties like laptops and desktops. As a result, Microsoft announced it is raising the price of its Xbox Series X by $100 to $599. The company also said it’s raising the price of some of its first-party games to $79 from $69.

NVDA,wallstreetbets,I all-in'd and held 400k in UVIX for 6 months. I finally sold.,"First off, I would like to preface this with saying my condolences to those who have incurred any losses lately. It has been a very volatile week, and I know many friends and family who have suffered heavy losses in their portfolio and are stressed/anxious for the future to come. With that, I would like to share my experience betting against the American economy by holding one of the most volatile stock for 6 months, UVIX.

As many of you may know, VIX is an index that grows rapidly when the market reverses from a peak. I personally witnessed this during Covid (when TVIX rose almost 2000%) and the recent ""Yen Carry Trade"" of August 5th (when UVIX rose 400%). I've always aspired to time the market successfully with UVIX.

Last year, I felt that the economy was overextended for many reasons. You guys may not agree that these are factors to what led us here, but these are why I ended up taking the biggest risk of my life with such high confidence that the market would crash short-term.

\- US National Debt: We've reached a staggering $36 trillion debt, a large increase of 8 trillion post-covid. To me, this was a huge red flag indicating a looming recession, especially since the market was still pumping.

\- AI Bubble: I think AI is heavily over-hyped, and the rise of NVDA/Tech stocks were not really warranted. I saw this as a bubble bound to pop, much like the dot-com and housing bubble of 2008.

\- Terrible job market: I think we've been experiencing a bad labor market across all sectors for a while now. Employers look to make lay-offs/cost cutting in order to artificially inflate profit margins to boost stock prices, which is not sustainable. I do not believe the numbers released by the Feds at all, they seem suspiciously low compared to real-world experiences of people struggling to find work. This article was one example:  
[https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/us-added-818000-fewer-jobs-thought-adding-concerns-economy-rcna167555](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/us-added-818000-fewer-jobs-thought-adding-concerns-economy-rcna167555)

\- Suicide rate is apparently one of the leading indicator of a struggling economy: In 2024, we reached one of the highest rate in the decade [https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2024-09-26/u-s-suicide-rate-climbs-back-to-highest-in-decades](https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2024-09-26/u-s-suicide-rate-climbs-back-to-highest-in-decades)

\- Trump winning the presidential election: I was aware of his tariff plans during his campaign, and I knew that if he actually did implement these, it would shock the market. It was only a question of if he would actually deliver on his campaign promise or not, which he did.

With all these reasonings in mind, I had a 90% confidence that the market would crash soon, so I YOLO'd my whole portfolio into UVIX after election.

https://preview.redd.it/ovma6m9vj3ue1.png?width=1093&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd719e0b6d0ff7892d07461aa3eae2312d52caea

Holding this ticker was mentally tough, the market kept rallying from 580 to 620 post-election, and my position was decaying and I was holding a -200k loss for the vast majority of the time. Many people discouraged my position, and some think I should cut my losses. I even isolated myself for a while because I was so sure of my bet. There were two moments when I could have sold to break even: Federal reserve announcing no future interest rate cuts and Trump's initial Canada/Mexico tariffs. But UVIX didn't rise as much as I anticipated, so I kept holding.

https://preview.redd.it/e5e6xfsxj3ue1.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f45917088fa769ca5123420f1fec427851fbb2f

Fast forward to last week, Trump announced a severe blanket tariff, which crashed the market as we know it. This was finally the moment I've been waiting for as UVIX went from $20 to $100 in the span of 4 days. I kept my eyes on the news, set my alarm to 6 am to watch the market open. UVIX could rapidly drop/rise in matter of seconds, and I did not want to sell too early/late, so I was shedding 1k shares a day to be safe. 1k at 70, 1k at 90, 2k at 100 on Tuesday. At this point, I had 3k remaining, and I was hoping that UVIX would maybe rise to 140, but then Trump sent out the tweet that he's basically cancelling the tariffs, which shot the market back up, and plummeted UVIX to 40, luckily I was able to salvage and sell at 56 on the way down. It wasn't quite the finish I was hoping for, but overall, I did get to gain roughly 250k off of my 400k bet.

https://preview.redd.it/k4bzie1sk3ue1.png?width=1093&format=png&auto=webp&s=f788c3fce00964a3a5e9f9202b6db85d3f5bda4a

Now that I've been able to cash out on the big -20% SPY crash I've anticipated, I am completely out of UVIX for now. Even if the market continues to fall, I have full confidence that we'll eventually recover back to our previous 620 ATH, so I'll be DCAing into SPXL/TQQQ from this point on until we reach that price.

https://preview.redd.it/8j48yvnul3ue1.png?width=1093&format=png&auto=webp&s=b68d62402c4fdc3ec905d7c036fcd3cee5ff37f1

In the end, I would not encourage anyone else to do what I did. Even with my conviction and accurate market reading, I had to hold UVIX for 6 months, which ended up being one of the most stressful thing I could do. I've lost sleep, became disillusioned with the economy/government, and absorbed more bad news than I could handle. I've internally cheered for bearish news, despite knowing it could mean hardship for many people.

I was somewhat lucky that Trump did indeed enact his tariffs, otherwise I may have been stuck holding a decaying position until it went to zero or was delisted.

In the end, I'm just relieved that I could finally exit my large UVIX positions, and I will never all-in again the way I did. I hoped you all enjoyed my perspective/story and I wish the best of you luck in navigating this volatile market.",5756,367,1744331806.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1jwdal8/i_allind_and_held_400k_in_uvix_for_6_months_i/,RoyTheRoyalBoy,"I all-in'd and held 400k in UVIX for 6 months.

It has been a very volatile week, and I know many friends and family who have suffered heavy losses in their portfolio and are stressed/anxious for the future to come. With that, I would like to share my experience betting against the American economy by holding one of the most volatile stock for 6 months, UVIX.

As many of you may know, VIX is an index that grows rapidly when the market reverses from a peak. I personally witnessed this during Covid (when TVIX rose almost 2000%) and the recent ""Yen Carry Trade"" of August 5th (when UVIX rose 400%). I've always aspired to time the market successfully with UVIX.

Last year, I felt that the economy was overextended for many reasons. You guys may not agree that these are factors to what led us here, but these are why I ended up taking the biggest risk of my life with such high confidence that the market would crash short-term.

\- US National Debt: We've reached a staggering $36 trillion debt, a large increase of 8 trillion post-covid. To me, this was a huge red flag indicating a looming recession, especially since the market was still pumping.

\- AI Bubble: I think AI is heavily over-hyped, and the rise of NVDA/Tech stocks were not really warranted. I saw this as a bubble bound to pop, much like the dot-com and housing bubble of 2008.

\- Terrible job market: I think we've been experiencing a bad labor market across all sectors for a while now. Employers look to make lay-offs/cost cutting in order to artificially inflate profit margins to boost stock prices, which is not sustainable. I do not believe the numbers released by the Feds at all, they seem suspiciously low compared to real-world experiences of people struggling to find work. This article was one example:

\- Suicide rate is apparently one of the leading indicator of a struggling economy: In 2024, we reached one of the highest rate in the decade [https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2024-09-26/u-s-suicide-rate-climbs-back-to-highest-in-decades](https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2024-09-26/u-s-suicide-rate-climbs-back-to-highest-in-decades)

\- Trump winning the presidential election: I was aware of his tariff plans during his campaign, and I knew that if he actually did implement these, it would shock the market. It was only a question of if he would actually deliver on his campaign promise or not, which he did.

With all these reasonings in mind, I had a 90% confidence that the market would crash soon, so I YOLO'd my whole portfolio into UVIX after election.

Holding this ticker was mentally tough, the market kept rallying from 580 to 620 post-election, and my position was decaying and I was holding a -200k loss for the vast majority of the time. Many people discouraged my position, and some think I should cut my losses. I even isolated myself for a while because I was so sure of my bet. There were two moments when I could have sold to break even: Federal reserve announcing no future interest rate cuts and Trump's initial Canada/Mexico tariffs. But UVIX didn't rise as much as I anticipated, so I kept holding.

Fast forward to last week, Trump announced a severe blanket tariff, which crashed the market as we know it. This was finally the moment I've been waiting for as UVIX went from $20 to $100 in the span of 4 days. I kept my eyes on the news, set my alarm to 6 am to watch the market open. UVIX could rapidly drop/rise in matter of seconds, and I did not want to sell too early/late, so I was shedding 1k shares a day to be safe. 1k at 70, 1k at 90, 2k at 100 on Tuesday. At this point, I had 3k remaining, and I was hoping that UVIX would maybe rise to 140, but then Trump sent out the tweet that he's basically cancelling the tariffs, which shot the market back up, and plummeted UVIX to 40, luckily I was able to salvage and sell at 56 on the way down. It wasn't quite the finish I was hoping for, but overall, I did get to gain roughly 250k off of my 400k bet.

Now that I've been able to cash out on the big -20% SPY crash I've anticipated, I am completely out of UVIX for now. Even if the market continues to fall, I have full confidence that we'll eventually recover back to our previous 620 ATH, so I'll be DCAing into SPXL/TQQQ from this point on until we reach that price.

In the end, I would not encourage anyone else to do what I did. Even with my conviction and accurate market reading, I had to hold UVIX for 6 months, which ended up being one of the most stressful thing I could do. I've lost sleep, became disillusioned with the economy/government, and absorbed more bad news than I could handle. I've internally cheered for bearish news, despite knowing it could mean hardship for many people.

I was somewhat lucky that Trump did indeed enact his tariffs, otherwise I may have been stuck holding a decaying position until it went to zero or was delisted.

In the end, I'm just relieved that I could finally exit my large UVIX positions, and I will never all-in again the way I did. I hoped you all enjoyed my perspective/story and I wish the best of you luck in navigating this volatile market.",-0.9376,Negative
