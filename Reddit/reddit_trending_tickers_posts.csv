It is a win for Google's cloud unit, which will supply additional computing capacity to OpenAI's existing infrastructure for training and running its AI models, sources said, who requested anonymity to discuss private matters. The move also comes as OpenAI's ChatGPT poses the biggest threat to Google's dominant search business in years, with Google executives recently saying that the AI race may not be winner-take-all.

Alright degenerates, hear me out.

$MODG (Topgolf Callaway Brands) is about to do something that very few are paying attention to — they’re spinning off their equipment division into a separate public company. This isn’t just corporate fluff — this is potentially rocket fuel.

Here’s why you should care:

Topgolf is the crown jewel – MODG owns Topgolf, which is basically the Dave & Buster’s of golf. Growing like crazy, expanding globally, and pulling in a younger demo. High margin, high growth, and borderline addictive for millennials and Zoomers.

The spinoff = multiple expansion – Wall Street loves a “pure play.” By splitting the slower, legacy equipment biz (Callaway clubs, balls, etc.) into its own entity, you free Topgolf from the drag. Investors can finally value Topgolf like a modern experiential brand, not a golf bag company.

Hidden value about to unlock – Analysts have consistently undervalued the company due to its blended structure. Post-spinoff, don’t be surprised if institutions jump in with fresh eyes and new models. It’s not a stretch to see this re-rated hard.

Add in the fact that the spinoff is expected to finalize in Q3 2025, and we’re looking at a classic “buy before the break” setup.

What am I missing here? Anyone else loading up pre-split or playing it through options?

Let’s talk — bullish case, bear case, or your favorite play structure. But either way, this might be the last chance to get in before this thing tees off.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1l7ij81/top_golf_and_callaway_spinoff/,1749508116.0,0,71,wallstreetbets

I left a good chunk of money on the table by mistiming the top, but I was (and remain) happy with the profits I took at the time, promising to keep an eye out for good re-entry points and jumped back in with more call options 2-3 months ago.

Alright degenerates, hear me out.

$MODG (Topgolf Callaway Brands) is about to do something that very few are paying attention to — they’re spinning off their equipment division into a separate public company. This isn’t just corporate fluff — this is potentially rocket fuel.

Here’s why you should care:

Topgolf is the crown jewel – MODG owns Topgolf, which is basically the Dave & Buster’s of golf. Growing like crazy, expanding globally, and pulling in a younger demo. High margin, high growth, and borderline addictive for millennials and Zoomers.

The spinoff = multiple expansion – Wall Street loves a “pure play.” By splitting the slower, legacy equipment biz (Callaway clubs, balls, etc.) into its own entity, you free Topgolf from the drag. Investors can finally value Topgolf like a modern experiential brand, not a golf bag company.

Hidden value about to unlock – Analysts have consistently undervalued the company due to its blended structure. Post-spinoff, don’t be surprised if institutions jump in with fresh eyes and new models. It’s not a stretch to see this re-rated hard.

Add in the fact that the spinoff is expected to finalize in Q3 2025, and we’re looking at a classic “buy before the break” setup.

What am I missing here? Anyone else loading up pre-split or playing it through options?

Little background: 
Company founded 2016 and was initially traded on the Austrian market . Moved to Nasdaq in 2023 and had a great run. Around Dec 2024 short seller Hindenburg research put out a hit piece and the stock dumped hard from Nov 24 to April 25. I posted on other sub Reddit about this stock when I sold some of my pltr gains and put it into this. it got very little traction 🤷‍♂️ but whatever people don’t want to make money thats on them . Good news I think she still has some left in the tank and am letting the house money ride after pulling out a bit of the gains at the start of this month and regretting it ever since. 

Why it’s worth a look now:
1) BNPL booming with younger generations and anyone with no money (aka most of us)

2)improving financials  with positive cash flow in the last earnings call looking good .

3) if consolidation occurs in this space Sezzle looks like a prime choice for a big player. 

4)MOST IMPORTANT POINT Sezzle used to be a Twolves floor sponsor and are currently the jersey sponsor. Thats a big D move . 

5) strong insider ownership ~53% last time I checked yahoo finance. 

6) jimmy chill said sell on Sezzle a few weeks ago on his lighting round seems like a good inverse Kramer play. I foolishly took some off and regretted but I was trying to not let the position be more than 20-25% of my over all holdings. 

TLDR : I think there are multiple player in fintech that have good times ahead .

S,1l736uz,Why Sweetgreen Is Undervalued,"So here’s my honest take on why I think Sweetgreen is undervalued compared to where it’s heading in the future. For some context, I’ve been slowly accumulating shares since February 21st, 2023, with my first buy being 106 shares at $9.38. I currently hold 3,194.055 shares at an average cost of $23.66—which is about $9.61 higher than where the stock is trading today.

Anyway, here’s what I think is going right for Sweetgreen right now, and what’s not going so great:


What’s Going Well

1. Rewards Program Rolling Out Nicely
They just launched a new rewards program that gives 10 points for every $1 spent—and they’re signing up 20,000 new members a week. This is huge because it’ll let them target offers by customer segment and even individually, which is something that’s worked really well for other fast-casual chains to drive better same-store sales and revenue growth.

2. Infinite Kitchen Expansion = Big Efficiency Gains
They’re on track to open 40 new stores this year, and at least 20 of those will be the new Infinite Kitchen format. Plus, they’ll be opening their first Infinite Kitchen with a drive-thru, which could be a big deal down the road—drive-thrus are super competitive but also super profitable if you do them right.

The Infinite Kitchen is already showing big improvements—like around 700 basis points in margin boost mostly from labor savings, plus a potential 100 basis point COGS improvement. That’s at least 7 percentage points from labor and 1 point from COGS compared to similar stores without the tech.

The first Infinite Kitchen store hit a 26% restaurant-level margin in its first full month—that’s way better than the 20.4% average across the chain at the time. Less staff, more accuracy, faster service. Huge win.

3. Right Target Customer
Millennials and Gen Z are their core customer base—which is perfect because these groups really care about health, sustainability, transparency… everything Sweetgreen leans into. Together they make up like 43% of the U.S. population. Long-term this is the group you want.

4. Revenue Still Growing Despite Everything
Even with all the macro headwinds, fires in California (where a lot of their stores are), reduced marketing, and seasonal menu pullbacks, they’re still growing revenue at over 15% year-over-year. That’s not bad considering everything going on.


Valuation is Dirt Cheap Compared to Peers…

Here’s the kicker no one seems to be talking about—Sweetgreen is dirt cheap compared to the comps.

Right now they trade at a 2.1x EV/FY 2025 revenue multiple. That’s less than half of Chipotle’s valuation, and below Cava and even McDonald’s—who’s also struggling to grow same-store sales right now.

Their guidance says they’ll end FY 2025 with 286 stores (adding 40 this year), which puts their valuation at around $5.5 million EV per store. Chipotle is sitting at $16.2 million EV per store (with over 4,000 stores expected by year-end).

So yeah—Sweetgreen stores are underperforming right now. But the top-line pressure is mostly macro-related (stuff that should pass) and the margin squeeze should ease as they roll out more Infinite Kitchens.

For long-term investors willing to wait this out, this is a super cheap stock on both a revenue and per-store basis.


What’s Not Going So Well

1. Same-Store Sales Took a Hit
Q1 2025 was rough—same-store sales dropped 3.1%, which was the first negative comp since their IPO in 2021. People are spending less on discretionary stuff, and the fast-casual space is super competitive right now.

But I honestly think this is a temporary issue—they’re in a weird transition period with the loyalty program, there were the California wildfires, and they pulled back seasonal menu items. My guess is by the back half of the year, comps will be back on track.

2. Portion Size Complaints = Real Problem
This one is more anecdotal but I’ve spent some time (probably way too much time) digging through social media and reviews—and there’s a common theme: people think portions are small for the price they’re paying. Price per calorie is way worse than competitors and that’s something they really need to fix if they want loyal, repeat customers.

The Infinite Kitchen should help with this since everything is measured perfectly—but honestly I’m surprised these places don’t have like portioning spoons or scales for proteins to make sure staff isn’t shorting people. Seems like such an easy win.

3. Can They Get Loyalty Members to Come Back More Often?
20,000 new signups a week is great—but if those people don’t come back more often, it won’t matter. They need to find a way to get those new members hooked and visiting more frequently. If they do, same-store sales could pop big time.


Why I’m Still Super Bullish

Look, despite all this, I think Sweetgreen has a shot to 10x in the next 5–10 years, which would get them to an $18–20 billion market cap. That’s not crazy when you look at Chipotle sitting at $70B and Cava at $10B.

Plus, they’ve got tons of optionality left—new menu stuff, handheld items, healthy fountain drinks like kombucha (super high margin). This is a company going through a rough patch, but I think they’ll come out the other side way stronger.

Every week I see the same doom porn  credit cracks, recession lurking, “this time it’s different”  and yet price action doesn’t care. You know why? Because when stuff does start breaking, the Fed eases. They don’t want a crash heading into an election year. They’ll pivot the second things get messy  
And the fear over rising delinquencies… yeah no kidding. What did you think would happen after the fastest hiking cycle in 40 years? Obviously credit gets tight. But this isn’t 2008. Unemployment is still under 4%, corporate balance sheets are solid, and the system isn’t imploding Chill  


The market’s not pricing in perfection. It’s pricing in “slightly less bad” and “maybe we get cuts”. Yields are easing, buybacks are rolling, and there’s no alternative that yields 30% YTD like $Qqq. Money has to go somewhere  


Truth is, most of you are still traumatized from 2022. You don’t trust green candles. You assume every rip is a bull trap. But markets don’t crash when everyone’s scared. They crash when everyone’s dancing on tables. Right now? Everyone’s still hiding in T-bills and buying puts  
You really think the S&P dumps while Apple is buying back stock like it’s a religion and boomers are auto-buying every paycheck? Come on  


And don’t even get me started on the Fed Powell’s out here praying the soft landing meme becomes real. They’re not raising again. They’re literally looking for a reason to cut. Give them one more bad payroll print and they’ll have the press release ready  
But sure, let me go sell all my longs and load puts because Starbucks missed same-store sales by 1.2%. Brilliant.  
This market isn’t euphoric  it’s hated. And that’s exactly why it keeps grinding higher

S,1l628m7,why GOOGL (Alphabet) is a great buy right now,"With WWDC and the Robotaxi event next week, I'd like to discuss Google and its parent company Alphabet, they have been in trouble for a while now regarding some bullshit anti-trust cases, and I want to tell you why its pure FUD.  Google has really caught up with the rest of the Mag 7 giants in their AI advancements if you haven't noticed.  They have been doing AI machine learning since 2001.  Bard was unimpressive, but that was only little over a year ago.  The speed at which they have been making new advancements is almost hard to track (even across other LLM's).

Have you tried Gemini?  VEO 3 costs 250/m and people are loving it. (the rev. from that will be great as well) and the new AI mode for search seems to finally have been embraced and I think they can actually leverage AI to better serve people the right business ads / referrals.  ***Either way they are monetizing AI***\*...\*

Regarding all the FUD, I dont believe the judge can make them sell chrome, EU case is just stupid, the whole thing is about them having monopoly on search and ads...  well there is Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo, Perplexity, Meta / Instagram business Ads, etc..  they have no monopoly anymore if there was one...

I dont believe the cases will result in anything materially bad for the stock but nobody can be sure, so that is why I want to dig into the Fundmental and Technical Analysis.

# ----------- Fundamentals -----------

Alphabet is a massive conglomerate with many subsidiaries.  Lets talk about how they are competing and kicking ass in so many different industries.

\-

**AI:**  

*VEO 3, AI Mode, Gemini, DeepMind* \- Competing with GPT pro, Microsoft, etc.  (note VEO 3 is still the only model that does text to video PLUS audio.  I think they leveraged youtube for it.

**Data Centers / Internet Provider:**

\-----*Google Cloud, TPU's, Google Fiber* \-Competing with many, but their TPU's are very good for AI data centers, and google Fiber competes with internet / service providers like AT&T / Comcast / T-Mobile, etc..

**Quantum Computing:**

\------Competing with Microsoft, IBM, Rigetti, etc.

**Smart Phones:**

\------*Android, Pixel Phone* (with Gemini that kicks Siri's ass) - competing with Apple big-time

**Streaming / Ads:**

\------*Youtube & Google Ads* \- Competing with Meta and Netflix

**Smart Home / Wearables:**

\------*Nest, Fitbit,* & ***XR Glasses*** \- Competing with Amazon, Apple's announced glasses and their 'watch', Microsoft, etc.

**Autonomous Driving / UAV Delivery:**

\------***Waymo, Wing*** \- Competing with Tesla (been kicking their ass on it for a while now), GM, and yes, Amazon Air delivery.  *They also just announced another partnership with Walmart to bring more drones to over 100 stores for deliveries!*

**AI in Healthcare / Biotech:**

\------*Verily, & Calico* \- working on aging / genetics and ai in healthcare.

\-*and probably a few others i've missed..*.  but the scope of their work is clear.

\-

When you buy GOOGL you are buying the entirety of Alphabets investments.  And they are so well positioned from a fundamental and financial perspective as seen in this group of charts.  They make double nearly double the revenue of Nvidia...

[Google makes more revenue than the rest of the Mag 7, nearly double Nvidia's earnings!  the only exception of Apple which could be in jeopardy too if they dont continue to innovate.](https://preview.redd.it/i61ok3bywl5f1.png?width=1183&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab383da02f61b9d5fdc7bb71ce2bde6c7d453ac2)

\-

Yet oddly, Google has the lowest P/E (price to earnings) ratio than the rest of the Mag 7!  That seems off if you ask me.  I believe they can take plenty of market share back in the future based on these 2 figures.

https://preview.redd.it/a61jyxhzwl5f1.png?width=1125&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b85188b91cd7b2b6b95516e18513586d86d630b

# -------- Technical Analysis --------

so now lets look at the Chart!  Because Price Action Speaks more than anything else...

I like to use Multiple Timeframes for analysis so here I have the 4 hour, daily, and weekly charts.

I know there are a lot of lines and colors, dont be scared.  The indicators I use are patterns combined with price action, fib levels, TTM squeeze, RSI and some other factors such as price gaps.

\- With RSI, above/below the 50 line tells you if momentum is bullish or bearish.  All the higher timeframes are above that 50 line indicating a potential bullish reversal.

\- With TTM it makes it easier to visualize these momentum shifts.  Right now my focus is on that Weekly chart on the bottom right - higher time frames are usually more important and it appears to be on the verge of a weekly breakout.  Now with a stock like this it could take months to reach that earnings Gap and make a new all time high.  When or If this happens depends on a lot of factors, but I am only focusing on the chart.

\- The Fibonacci Retracements I mostly use for the 50% line to determine if the price has had a change of trend.  Right now the price is attempting a breakout above this retracement and if it can break over 175 then there is plenty of room up.

\- Ive also illustrated some patterns and concepts on the chart.  Inverted Head and Shoulders, Trendline Break, Higher Highs and Higher Lows, potentially an even larger inverted H&S on the daily chart to the top right.

https://preview.redd.it/d2fprue33m5f1.jpg?width=3676&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=77f0a1e390e7b81ec6f893f6f38220ffc3fde21f

Ok so what does this technical analysis mumbo jumbo mean?  Its hard to say because of Trump, Tarrifs, Deals, Interest Rates, Bonds, Geopolitics, the fact that the market has already just about reached all time highs and this is lagging...  it is concerning.  It could also just be setting up for a massive (bearish) head and shoulders as you might notice on the bottom right weekly chart.

But with WWDC, RoboTaxi, and several trump deals supposedly taking place next week, we could be setup for some bullish continuation if these tech events impress.  Either way, Long Term I believe Google / Alphabet stock will get back to 200.

From a technical and fundamental perspective they are in great shape.  I would even bet that if the market pulls back, that institutions may rotate their Mag 7 holdings into the laggards such as this and Amazon.

While they are aggressively competing with so many different companies and industries, their earnings are expected to continue to grow and as you saw earlier, they earn double what Nvidia earns... Pelosi still has calls, and lets face it, you still use some kind of google product in your life whether its youtube, your android based phone, ai / gemini research, waymo, etc...  I believe Google is well positioned to be a winner this year in AI and many of its subsidiary company products.

\--------------

# TLDR:

**Alphabet is a great Bet !**

I currently am selling put credit spreads on GOOGL, and have several 180 calls for 7/18 that I only plan to hold through next week before I re-enter as there is going to be a lot going on next week for the markets.  Their earnings are on 7/22 I believe, so August may be a better strike date.  Shares or LEAPS (calls dated atleast for 2026) are also a good idea IMO, you can sell calls against them to hedge when there are large spikes.

**Anyway, I am highly regarded** ***and this is not financial advice,*** but I am very bullish on Google long term.  Its not an easy one to trade if you like short dated options, you need patience, but the chart, the p/e ratios, the incredible amount of subsidiaries competing with more than other Mag 7 companies makes this thing a highly undervalued growth & value stock.

*Price Target short term - 180*

*Price Target long term - 200+*

YOU,1l7wetd,Should you buy the dip? I analyzed all S&P 500 companies to find what happens if we only invest in companies undergoing drawdowns.,"To test, I picked all the companies in the S&P 500 list as of 2015. The backtest is simple— If a company drops by 50%, we invest $100 in that company and then hold.

I immediately ran into an issue. Out of the 502 companies on the list, 262 companies experienced a drawdown of more than 50% over the last 10 years. If you end up investing in all of them, your average return will be comparable to the index since you are holding half the index. *(Average return of 114% for the drawdown portfolio vs. 123% for the S&P 500).*

**Where it gets interesting is when we increase the drawdown cutoffs.**

# Drawdown cutoff — 75%

* Number of stocks: 91
* Total amount of investment: $9,500
* Drawdown portfolio final value (June’25): $23,903 **(151% return)**
* Comparable S&P 500 index: $20,467 **(115% return)**
* Alpha — 36%
* Median return: 68.4%

# Best and worst performers

As you would expect, investing in companies that had significant drawdowns would be highly volatile. After all, a stock that went down 90% can again go down another 90%!

Buy and hold seems to be the best strategy, as there would be many multi-baggers..

YOU,1l7ij81,Top Golf and Callaway spinoff,"$MODG — Upcoming Spinoff Could Be the Launchpad. Don’t Sleep on This One.

Alright degenerates, hear me out.

$MODG (Topgolf Callaway Brands) is about to do something that very few are paying attention to — they’re spinning off their equipment division into a separate public company. This isn’t just corporate fluff — this is potentially rocket fuel.

Here’s why you should care:

Topgolf is the crown jewel – MODG owns Topgolf, which is basically the Dave & Buster’s of golf. Growing like crazy, expanding globally, and pulling in a younger demo. High margin, high growth, and borderline addictive for millennials and Zoomers.

The spinoff = multiple expansion – Wall Street loves a “pure play.” By splitting the slower, legacy equipment biz (Callaway clubs, balls, etc.) into its own entity, you free Topgolf from the drag. Investors can finally value Topgolf like a modern experiential brand, not a golf bag company.

Hidden value about to unlock – Analysts have consistently undervalued the company due to its blended structure. Post-spinoff, don’t be surprised if institutions jump in with fresh eyes and new models. It’s not a stretch to see this re-rated hard.

Add in the fact that the spinoff is expected to finalize in Q3 2025, and we’re looking at a classic “buy before the break” setup.

What am I missing here? Anyone else loading up pre-split or playing it through options?

Let’s talk — bullish case, bear case, or your favorite play structure. But either way, this might be the last chance to get in before this thing tees off.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1l7ij81/top_golf_and_callaway_spinoff/,1749508116.0,0,71,wallstreetbets
YOU,1l7hth1,Nearly $10K Profit on HOOD Today:  Puts and Calls,"So I started today with HOOD Puts only that I bought last week.  I saw that everyone was betting that HOOD would get the S&P inclusion so I faded the groupthink with 101 puts at a cost basis of about $1.72 per contract.  

When market opened I was hoping for a big selloff.  But man….this stock is just a beast.  As soon as I saw the $70 level being reclaimed I slowly sold off all of my puts for a ~$7K profit.

I then decided to join the Bulls and flipped long only and bought 87 calls at a cost basis of $2.40 per contract.

The lesson of today is:  Don’t fight the tape kids.

YOU,1l7ccch,Fintech seems like it could have legs for a while and SEZL will be my dark horse for this year and beyond.,"I will keep this short  as no one wants another AI generated dumpster fire . Yes i have a position see photos , all shares no calls which is a bummer. 

Little background: 
Company founded 2016 and was initially traded on the Austrian market . Moved to Nasdaq in 2023 and had a great run. Around Dec 2024 short seller Hindenburg research put out a hit piece and the stock dumped hard from Nov 24 to April 25. I posted on other sub Reddit about this stock when I sold some of my pltr gains and put it into this. it got very little traction 🤷‍♂️ but whatever people don’t want to make money thats on them . Good news I think she still has some left in the tank and am letting the house money ride after pulling out a bit of the gains at the start of this month and regretting it ever since. 

Why it’s worth a look now:
1) BNPL booming with younger generations and anyone with no money (aka most of us)

2)improving financials  with positive cash flow in the last earnings call looking good .

3) if consolidation occurs in this space Sezzle looks like a prime choice for a big player. 

4)MOST IMPORTANT POINT Sezzle used to be a Twolves floor sponsor and are currently the jersey sponsor. Thats a big D move . 

5) strong insider ownership ~53% last time I checked yahoo finance. 

6) jimmy chill said sell on Sezzle a few weeks ago on his lighting round seems like a good inverse Kramer play. I foolishly took some off and regretted but I was trying to not let the position be more than 20-25% of my over all holdings. 

TLDR : I think there are multiple player in fintech that have good times ahead .

YOU,1l736uz,Why Sweetgreen Is Undervalued,"So here’s my honest take on why I think Sweetgreen is undervalued compared to where it’s heading in the future. For some context, I’ve been slowly accumulating shares since February 21st, 2023, with my first buy being 106 shares at $9.38. I currently hold 3,194.055 shares at an average cost of $23.66—which is about $9.61 higher than where the stock is trading today.

Anyway, here’s what I think is going right for Sweetgreen right now, and what’s not going so great:


What’s Going Well

1. Rewards Program Rolling Out Nicely
They just launched a new rewards program that gives 10 points for every $1 spent—and they’re signing up 20,000 new members a week. This is huge because it’ll let them target offers by customer segment and even individually, which is something that’s worked really well for other fast-casual chains to drive better same-store sales and revenue growth.

2. Infinite Kitchen Expansion = Big Efficiency Gains
They’re on track to open 40 new stores this year, and at least 20 of those will be the new Infinite Kitchen format. Plus, they’ll be opening their first Infinite Kitchen with a drive-thru, which could be a big deal down the road—drive-thrus are super competitive but also super profitable if you do them right.

The Infinite Kitchen is already showing big improvements—like around 700 basis points in margin boost mostly from labor savings, plus a potential 100 basis point COGS improvement. That’s at least 7 percentage points from labor and 1 point from COGS compared to similar stores without the tech.

The first Infinite Kitchen store hit a 26% restaurant-level margin in its first full month—that’s way better than the 20.4% average across the chain at the time. Less staff, more accuracy, faster service. Huge win.

3. Right Target Customer
Millennials and Gen Z are their core customer base—which is perfect because these groups really care about health, sustainability, transparency… everything Sweetgreen leans into. Together they make up like 43% of the U.S. population. Long-term this is the group you want.

4. Revenue Still Growing Despite Everything
Even with all the macro headwinds, fires in California (where a lot of their stores are), reduced marketing, and seasonal menu pullbacks, they’re still growing revenue at over 15% year-over-year. That’s not bad considering everything going on.


Valuation is Dirt Cheap Compared to Peers…

Here’s the kicker no one seems to be talking about—Sweetgreen is dirt cheap compared to the comps.

Right now they trade at a 2.1x EV/FY 2025 revenue multiple. That’s less than half of Chipotle’s valuation, and below Cava and even McDonald’s—who’s also struggling to grow same-store sales right now.

Their guidance says they’ll end FY 2025 with 286 stores (adding 40 this year), which puts their valuation at around $5.5 million EV per store. Chipotle is sitting at $16.2 million EV per store (with over 4,000 stores expected by year-end).

So yeah—Sweetgreen stores are underperforming right now. But the top-line pressure is mostly macro-related (stuff that should pass) and the margin squeeze should ease as they roll out more Infinite Kitchens.

For long-term investors willing to wait this out, this is a super cheap stock on both a revenue and per-store basis.


What’s Not Going So Well

1. Same-Store Sales Took a Hit
Q1 2025 was rough—same-store sales dropped 3.1%, which was the first negative comp since their IPO in 2021. People are spending less on discretionary stuff, and the fast-casual space is super competitive right now.

But I honestly think this is a temporary issue—they’re in a weird transition period with the loyalty program, there were the California wildfires, and they pulled back seasonal menu items. My guess is by the back half of the year, comps will be back on track.

2. Portion Size Complaints = Real Problem
This one is more anecdotal but I’ve spent some time (probably way too much time) digging through social media and reviews—and there’s a common theme: people think portions are small for the price they’re paying. Price per calorie is way worse than competitors and that’s something they really need to fix if they want loyal, repeat customers.

The Infinite Kitchen should help with this since everything is measured perfectly—but honestly I’m surprised these places don’t have like portioning spoons or scales for proteins to make sure staff isn’t shorting people. Seems like such an easy win.

3. Can They Get Loyalty Members to Come Back More Often?
20,000 new signups a week is great—but if those people don’t come back more often, it won’t matter. They need to find a way to get those new members hooked and visiting more frequently. If they do, same-store sales could pop big time.


Why I’m Still Super Bullish

Look, despite all this, I think Sweetgreen has a shot to 10x in the next 5–10 years, which would get them to an $18–20 billion market cap. That’s not crazy when you look at Chipotle sitting at $70B and Cava at $10B.

Plus, they’ve got tons of optionality left—new menu stuff, handheld items, healthy fountain drinks like kombucha (super high margin). This is a company going through a rough patch, but I think they’ll come out the other side way stronger.

I’m long ~3,100 shares plus October 2024 call options.

YOU,1l6rv8n,Verizon looks primed for a big rally.,"I'll keep this short and sweet, but here are the bullet points :

* Technically-speaking, VZ has been consolidating in a Bullish Pennant for weeks, it has reached the end of the pennant and looks poised to breakout. Call option volume has been picking up over this time, and puts have steadily been closing.
* When QQQ falls, people tend to seek safety in stable, high-dividend stocks like VZ (which generates a high 6%+ dividend). 
* Generally-speaking, VZ tends to be quite resilient when the market corrects. Especially when tech falls. If you put the 2 charts together, every time QQQ falls, VZ pumps. QQQ is forming a bearish divergence on the daily chart, and is looking ready to retrace a bit (there is also a gap fill that could occur down a little ways on QQQ, which could further fuel the pump in VZ).
* Most of the volume recently seems to be hedge funds hoarding shares. I've been browsing through the trade history and options flow. The $45 call has 40K+ OI, I've watched OI on that strike alone double over the past week, the stock could get gamma-squeezed. Weekly volume is increasing. Sentiment is 85% bullish. \*weekly chart pictured\*
* If tech stocks take a breather, which IMO it looks like they will this week, I think seeing 1 high volume green candle on VZ daily chart will confirm the breakout.
* Analyst estimates range from $47-55 for the year, I think it could start climbing into that range soon. When VZ rallies, it tends to rally 10-20% over a couple of weeks. Depending on where you measure the pennant pole, the target would be from \~$50-$55.

I think if there is anything that causes people to seek shelter outside of the bond market, which has been struggling lately, VZ is a prime candidate, and from a technical analysis perspective, it looks primed to rally hard.

Do what you will with this information. Godspeed regards!

Ps. The stock doesn't ""only"" rally when tech ETFs sink, it just happens to correlate with those declines a lot of the time.",https://i.redd.it/orw0m6zjus5f1.png,1749430657.0,0,147,wallstreetbets

YOU,1l6dfob,"Powell praying AI paying, boomers buying  and you wanna short this","Honestly I still don’t get why people are so aggressively bearish. Like yeah, consumer data looks weak, retail earnings are trash, housing is soft  cool we get it. That’s been true for months  But have you actually looked at what moves the market right now?  


Big tech is absolutely ripping  AI isn’t some future fantasy  it’s real spend, real revenue, real margins. Nvda adds $300B in a week, Msft printing, Goog melting up  even Apple finally waking up. That’s literally half the index. And people think the S&P’s just gonna collapse? Lmao  


Every week I see the same doom porn  credit cracks, recession lurking, “this time it’s different”  and yet price action doesn’t care. You know why? Because when stuff does start breaking, the Fed eases. They don’t want a crash heading into an election year. They’ll pivot the second things get messy  
And the fear over rising delinquencies… yeah no kidding. What did you think would happen after the fastest hiking cycle in 40 years? Obviously credit gets tight. But this isn’t 2008. Unemployment is still under 4%, corporate balance sheets are solid, and the system isn’t imploding Chill  


The market’s not pricing in perfection. It’s pricing in “slightly less bad” and “maybe we get cuts”. Yields are easing, buybacks are rolling, and there’s no alternative that yields 30% YTD like $Qqq. Money has to go somewhere  


Truth is, most of you are still traumatized from 2022. You don’t trust green candles. You assume every rip is a bull trap. But markets don’t crash when everyone’s scared. They crash when everyone’s dancing on tables. Right now? Everyone’s still hiding in T-bills and buying puts  
You really think the S&P dumps while Apple is buying back stock like it’s a religion and boomers are auto-buying every paycheck? Come on  


And don’t even get me started on the Fed Powell’s out here praying the soft landing meme becomes real. They’re not raising again. They’re literally looking for a reason to cut. Give them one more bad payroll print and they’ll have the press release ready  
But sure, let me go sell all my longs and load puts because Starbucks missed same-store sales by 1.2%. Brilliant.  
This market isn’t euphoric  it’s hated. And that’s exactly why it keeps grinding higher

YOU,1l628m7,why GOOGL (Alphabet) is a great buy right now,"With WWDC and the Robotaxi event next week, I'd like to discuss Google and its parent company Alphabet, they have been in trouble for a while now regarding some bullshit anti-trust cases, and I want to tell you why its pure FUD.  Google has really caught up with the rest of the Mag 7 giants in their AI advancements if you haven't noticed.  They have been doing AI machine learning since 2001.  Bard was unimpressive, but that was only little over a year ago.  The speed at which they have been making new advancements is almost hard to track (even across other LLM's).

Have you tried Gemini?  VEO 3 costs 250/m and people are loving it. (the rev. from that will be great as well) and the new AI mode for search seems to finally have been embraced and I think they can actually leverage AI to better serve people the right business ads / referrals.  ***Either way they are monetizing AI***\*...\*

Regarding all the FUD, I dont believe the judge can make them sell chrome, EU case is just stupid, the whole thing is about them having monopoly on search and ads...  well there is Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo, Perplexity, Meta / Instagram business Ads, etc..  they have no monopoly anymore if there was one...

I dont believe the cases will result in anything materially bad for the stock but nobody can be sure, so that is why I want to dig into the Fundmental and Technical Analysis.

# ----------- Fundamentals -----------

Alphabet is a massive conglomerate with many subsidiaries.  Lets talk about how they are competing and kicking ass in so many different industries.

\-

**AI:**  

*VEO 3, AI Mode, Gemini, DeepMind* \- Competing with GPT pro, Microsoft, etc.  (note VEO 3 is still the only model that does text to video PLUS audio.  I think they leveraged youtube for it.

**Data Centers / Internet Provider:**

\-----*Google Cloud, TPU's, Google Fiber* \-Competing with many, but their TPU's are very good for AI data centers, and google Fiber competes with internet / service providers like AT&T / Comcast / T-Mobile, etc..

**Quantum Computing:**

\------Competing with Microsoft, IBM, Rigetti, etc.

**Smart Phones:**

\------*Android, Pixel Phone* (with Gemini that kicks Siri's ass) - competing with Apple big-time

**Streaming / Ads:**

\------*Youtube & Google Ads* \- Competing with Meta and Netflix

**Smart Home / Wearables:**

\------*Nest, Fitbit,* & ***XR Glasses*** \- Competing with Amazon, Apple's announced glasses and their 'watch', Microsoft, etc.

**Autonomous Driving / UAV Delivery:**

\------***Waymo, Wing*** \- Competing with Tesla (been kicking their ass on it for a while now), GM, and yes, Amazon Air delivery.  *They also just announced another partnership with Walmart to bring more drones to over 100 stores for deliveries!*

**AI in Healthcare / Biotech:**

\------*Verily, & Calico* \- working on aging / genetics and ai in healthcare.

\-*and probably a few others i've missed..*.  but the scope of their work is clear.

\-

When you buy GOOGL you are buying the entirety of Alphabets investments.  And they are so well positioned from a fundamental and financial perspective as seen in this group of charts.  They make double nearly double the revenue of Nvidia...

[Google makes more revenue than the rest of the Mag 7, nearly double Nvidia's earnings!  the only exception of Apple which could be in jeopardy too if they dont continue to innovate.](https://preview.redd.it/i61ok3bywl5f1.png?width=1183&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab383da02f61b9d5fdc7bb71ce2bde6c7d453ac2)

\-

Yet oddly, Google has the lowest P/E (price to earnings) ratio than the rest of the Mag 7!  That seems off if you ask me.  I believe they can take plenty of market share back in the future based on these 2 figures.

https://preview.redd.it/a61jyxhzwl5f1.png?width=1125&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b85188b91cd7b2b6b95516e18513586d86d630b

\-

# -------- Technical Analysis --------

so now lets look at the Chart!  Because Price Action Speaks more than anything else...

I like to use Multiple Timeframes for analysis so here I have the 4 hour, daily, and weekly charts.

I know there are a lot of lines and colors, dont be scared.  The indicators I use are patterns combined with price action, fib levels, TTM squeeze, RSI and some other factors such as price gaps.

\- With RSI, above/below the 50 line tells you if momentum is bullish or bearish.  All the higher timeframes are above that 50 line indicating a potential bullish reversal.

\- With TTM it makes it easier to visualize these momentum shifts.  Right now my focus is on that Weekly chart on the bottom right - higher time frames are usually more important and it appears to be on the verge of a weekly breakout.  Now with a stock like this it could take months to reach that earnings Gap and make a new all time high.  When or If this happens depends on a lot of factors, but I am only focusing on the chart.

\- The Fibonacci Retracements I mostly use for the 50% line to determine if the price has had a change of trend.  Right now the price is attempting a breakout above this retracement and if it can break over 175 then there is plenty of room up.

\- Ive also illustrated some patterns and concepts on the chart.  Inverted Head and Shoulders, Trendline Break, Higher Highs and Higher Lows, potentially an even larger inverted H&S on the daily chart to the top right.

https://preview.redd.it/d2fprue33m5f1.jpg?width=3676&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=77f0a1e390e7b81ec6f893f6f38220ffc3fde21f

Ok so what does this technical analysis mumbo jumbo mean?  Its hard to say because of Trump, Tarrifs, Deals, Interest Rates, Bonds, Geopolitics, the fact that the market has already just about reached all time highs and this is lagging...  it is concerning.  It could also just be setting up for a massive (bearish) head and shoulders as you might notice on the bottom right weekly chart.

But with WWDC, RoboTaxi, and several trump deals supposedly taking place next week, we could be setup for some bullish continuation if these tech events impress.  Either way, Long Term I believe Google / Alphabet stock will get back to 200.

From a technical and fundamental perspective they are in great shape.  I would even bet that if the market pulls back, that institutions may rotate their Mag 7 holdings into the laggards such as this and Amazon.

While they are aggressively competing with so many different companies and industries, their earnings are expected to continue to grow and as you saw earlier, they earn double what Nvidia earns... Pelosi still has calls, and lets face it, you still use some kind of google product in your life whether its youtube, your android based phone, ai / gemini research, waymo, etc...  I believe Google is well positioned to be a winner this year in AI and many of its subsidiary company products.

\--------------

# TLDR:

**Alphabet is a great Bet !**

I currently am selling put credit spreads on GOOGL, and have several 180 calls for 7/18 that I only plan to hold through next week before I re-enter as there is going to be a lot going on next week for the markets.  Their earnings are on 7/22 I believe, so August may be a better strike date.  Shares or LEAPS (calls dated atleast for 2026) are also a good idea IMO, you can sell calls against them to hedge when there are large spikes.

**Anyway, I am highly regarded** ***and this is not financial advice,*** but I am very bullish on Google long term.  Its not an easy one to trade if you like short dated options, you need patience, but the chart, the p/e ratios, the incredible amount of subsidiaries competing with more than other Mag 7 companies makes this thing a highly undervalued growth & value stock.

*Price Target short term - 180*

*Price Target long term - 200+*

OR,1l0tpfk,$JACK recovery?  Or insolvency?,"Does anyone have thoughts or DD on this?

The 5-year chart looks abysmal. They peaked at about $120 in April 2021. Before this, on the 10-year chart (not shown bc the app says only 1 pic allowed per post), you can see long term stability (with moderate fluctuations that usually served as excellent buying opportunities).  Since April 2021, the stock has fallen to 1/6th of that value, now beneath $19/share.  If they were ever to rebound—and that’s a BIG IF—that would be up to a 6-fold gain. 

They have a new CEO since the first one looted the company and drove it into the ground. 

They canceled their excellent dividends, which was my incentive to remain holding shares. The stock has tanked 20% since they’ve done this (and that was fast, about 1 month). 

They are closing stores, I think about 5% of them. 

They bought Del Taco in 2022 and are looking to sell it in 2025 for a few hundred million in losses. 

That all sounds bad, but supposedly the reason they lost so much value is because they took on so much debt.  And these measures are debt-reducing, supposedly. 

So it may be a long term play, but does it seem like a rebound is possible or likely?  

Or does it seem like it will keep dropping and potentially go bust?  If it keeps going downdowndown, is this not a great play for Puts?

There is still much territory in the US and abroad where JACK has not expanded. Comparing to McD and Burger King, both of which are available in all 50 States and in Europe/Americas, there is tons of room for growth. But playing it right is extremely hard apparently. I am sure there is loads of brand-refinement that they can do (eg White-washing the whole brand and hiring clean young people to be more like In-N-Out) but the new CEO would rather hire T-Pain to be a spokesperson. Yes, seriously, T-Pain in 2025.

Personally, I don’t think it is going back to $120.  But it could bounce back to $40 or even up to $70. 

- when rates finally drop, debt-heavy businesses will surge, this being a prime example. 
- when they offload Del Taco or make it profitable and swallow that $400 million loss, they’ll at least be on the road to recovery, even though that’s a lot of 99¢ tacos they’ll need to sell to recover. 
- when the Ukraine war ends, in general, that will be good for the entire market. Why?  I don’t know. But the market hated the start of the war, so I presume the opposite will happen when it ends. But the end seems to be nowhere in sight unfortunately.  

Any thoughts out there?

Worth buying shares?
Worth buying calls?
Worth buying puts?

My positions are shares, about 200 average at $55, which means now I can’t even afford their tacos.

The embargo level tarrif of 145% currently in place re China will cause a recession if not immediately lowered. Since lowering it to 80% (like Trump suggested via Truth a few days ago) or even 50% is still embargo level, it make sense that there is a high chance its way lower than the market expects, think 25-20% or lower! This would also make it easy for the Chinese to accept the deal, since they wont lose face (they want 0% after all). If the Chinese accepted 50%, its still embargo level, and they might think thats not saving face. I.e. the necessity of having to reduce the tarrif to a non embargo level plus China wanting to save face, means that it might be near 25-20% or lower, which would come as a positive shock to the market (think 5% rally on the S&P).

IT,1l7ij81,Top Golf and Callaway spinoff,"$MODG — Upcoming Spinoff Could Be the Launchpad. Don’t Sleep on This One.

Alright degenerates, hear me out.

$MODG (Topgolf Callaway Brands) is about to do something that very few are paying attention to — they’re spinning off their equipment division into a separate public company. This isn’t just corporate fluff — this is potentially rocket fuel.

Here’s why you should care:

Topgolf is the crown jewel – MODG owns Topgolf, which is basically the Dave & Buster’s of golf. Growing like crazy, expanding globally, and pulling in a younger demo. High margin, high growth, and borderline addictive for millennials and Zoomers.

The spinoff = multiple expansion – Wall Street loves a “pure play.” By splitting the slower, legacy equipment biz (Callaway clubs, balls, etc.) into its own entity, you free Topgolf from the drag. Investors can finally value Topgolf like a modern experiential brand, not a golf bag company.

Hidden value about to unlock – Analysts have consistently undervalued the company due to its blended structure. Post-spinoff, don’t be surprised if institutions jump in with fresh eyes and new models. It’s not a stretch to see this re-rated hard.

Add in the fact that the spinoff is expected to finalize in Q3 2025, and we’re looking at a classic “buy before the break” setup.

I immediately ran into an issue. Out of the 502 companies on the list, 262 companies experienced a drawdown of more than 50% over the last 10 years. If you end up investing in all of them, your average return will be comparable to the index since you are holding half the index. *(Average return of 114% for the drawdown portfolio vs. 123% for the S&P 500).*

ARE,1l7ccch,Fintech seems like it could have legs for a while and SEZL will be my dark horse for this year and beyond.,"I will keep this short  as no one wants another AI generated dumpster fire . Yes i have a position see photos , all shares no calls which is a bummer. 

Little background: 
Company founded 2016 and was initially traded on the Austrian market . Moved to Nasdaq in 2023 and had a great run. Around Dec 2024 short seller Hindenburg research put out a hit piece and the stock dumped hard from Nov 24 to April 25. I posted on other sub Reddit about this stock when I sold some of my pltr gains and put it into this. it got very little traction 🤷‍♂️ but whatever people don’t want to make money thats on them . Good news I think she still has some left in the tank and am letting the house money ride after pulling out a bit of the gains at the start of this month and regretting it ever since. 

Why it’s worth a look now:
1) BNPL booming with younger generations and anyone with no money (aka most of us)

2)improving financials  with positive cash flow in the last earnings call looking good .

3) if consolidation occurs in this space Sezzle looks like a prime choice for a big player. 

4)MOST IMPORTANT POINT Sezzle used to be a Twolves floor sponsor and are currently the jersey sponsor. Thats a big D move . 

5) strong insider ownership ~53% last time I checked yahoo finance. 

6) jimmy chill said sell on Sezzle a few weeks ago on his lighting round seems like a good inverse Kramer play. I foolishly took some off and regretted but I was trying to not let the position be more than 20-25% of my over all holdings. 

TLDR : I think there are multiple player in fintech that have good times ahead . I’m long SEZL As well as SoFi and looking to open a position on Robinhood but wanted to wait for the S&P rebalancing news.

ARE,1l736uz,Why Sweetgreen Is Undervalued,"So here’s my honest take on why I think Sweetgreen is undervalued compared to where it’s heading in the future. For some context, I’ve been slowly accumulating shares since February 21st, 2023, with my first buy being 106 shares at $9.38. I currently hold 3,194.055 shares at an average cost of $23.66—which is about $9.61 higher than where the stock is trading today.

Anyway, here’s what I think is going right for Sweetgreen right now, and what’s not going so great:


What’s Going Well

1. Rewards Program Rolling Out Nicely
They just launched a new rewards program that gives 10 points for every $1 spent—and they’re signing up 20,000 new members a week. This is huge because it’ll let them target offers by customer segment and even individually, which is something that’s worked really well for other fast-casual chains to drive better same-store sales and revenue growth.

2. Infinite Kitchen Expansion = Big Efficiency Gains
They’re on track to open 40 new stores this year, and at least 20 of those will be the new Infinite Kitchen format. Plus, they’ll be opening their first Infinite Kitchen with a drive-thru, which could be a big deal down the road—drive-thrus are super competitive but also super profitable if you do them right.

The Infinite Kitchen is already showing big improvements—like around 700 basis points in margin boost mostly from labor savings, plus a potential 100 basis point COGS improvement. That’s at least 7 percentage points from labor and 1 point from COGS compared to similar stores without the tech.

The first Infinite Kitchen store hit a 26% restaurant-level margin in its first full month—that’s way better than the 20.4% average across the chain at the time. Less staff, more accuracy, faster service. Huge win.

3. Right Target Customer
Millennials and Gen Z are their core customer base—which is perfect because these groups really care about health, sustainability, transparency… everything Sweetgreen leans into. Together they make up like 43% of the U.S. population. Long-term this is the group you want.

4. Revenue Still Growing Despite Everything
Even with all the macro headwinds, fires in California (where a lot of their stores are), reduced marketing, and seasonal menu pullbacks, they’re still growing revenue at over 15% year-over-year. That’s not bad considering everything going on.


Valuation is Dirt Cheap Compared to Peers…

Here’s the kicker no one seems to be talking about—Sweetgreen is dirt cheap compared to the comps.

Right now they trade at a 2.1x EV/FY 2025 revenue multiple. That’s less than half of Chipotle’s valuation, and below Cava and even McDonald’s—who’s also struggling to grow same-store sales right now.

Their guidance says they’ll end FY 2025 with 286 stores (adding 40 this year), which puts their valuation at around $5.5 million EV per store. Chipotle is sitting at $16.2 million EV per store (with over 4,000 stores expected by year-end).

So yeah—Sweetgreen stores are underperforming right now. But the top-line pressure is mostly macro-related (stuff that should pass) and the margin squeeze should ease as they roll out more Infinite Kitchens.

For long-term investors willing to wait this out, this is a super cheap stock on both a revenue and per-store basis.


What’s Not Going So Well

1. Same-Store Sales Took a Hit
Q1 2025 was rough—same-store sales dropped 3.1%, which was the first negative comp since their IPO in 2021. People are spending less on discretionary stuff, and the fast-casual space is super competitive right now.

But I honestly think this is a temporary issue—they’re in a weird transition period with the loyalty program, there were the California wildfires, and they pulled back seasonal menu items. My guess is by the back half of the year, comps will be back on track.

2. Portion Size Complaints = Real Problem
This one is more anecdotal but I’ve spent some time (probably way too much time) digging through social media and reviews—and there’s a common theme: people think portions are small for the price they’re paying. Price per calorie is way worse than competitors and that’s something they really need to fix if they want loyal, repeat customers.

The Infinite Kitchen should help with this since everything is measured perfectly—but honestly I’m surprised these places don’t have like portioning spoons or scales for proteins to make sure staff isn’t shorting people. Seems like such an easy win.

3. Can They Get Loyalty Members to Come Back More Often?
20,000 new signups a week is great—but if those people don’t come back more often, it won’t matter. They need to find a way to get those new members hooked and visiting more frequently. If they do, same-store sales could pop big time.


Why I’m Still Super Bullish

Look, despite all this, I think Sweetgreen has a shot to 10x in the next 5–10 years, which would get them to an $18–20 billion market cap. That’s not crazy when you look at Chipotle sitting at $70B and Cava at $10B.

Plus, they’ve got tons of optionality left—new menu stuff, handheld items, healthy fountain drinks like kombucha (super high margin). This is a company going through a rough patch, but I think they’ll come out the other side way stronger.

ARE,1l6rv8n,Verizon looks primed for a big rally.,"I'll keep this short and sweet, but here are the bullet points :

* Technically-speaking, VZ has been consolidating in a Bullish Pennant for weeks, it has reached the end of the pennant and looks poised to breakout. Call option volume has been picking up over this time, and puts have steadily been closing.
* When QQQ falls, people tend to seek safety in stable, high-dividend stocks like VZ (which generates a high 6%+ dividend). 
* Generally-speaking, VZ tends to be quite resilient when the market corrects. Especially when tech falls. If you put the 2 charts together, every time QQQ falls, VZ pumps. QQQ is forming a bearish divergence on the daily chart, and is looking ready to retrace a bit (there is also a gap fill that could occur down a little ways on QQQ, which could further fuel the pump in VZ).
* Most of the volume recently seems to be hedge funds hoarding shares. I've been browsing through the trade history and options flow. The $45 call has 40K+ OI, I've watched OI on that strike alone double over the past week, the stock could get gamma-squeezed. Weekly volume is increasing. Sentiment is 85% bullish. \*weekly chart pictured\*
* If tech stocks take a breather, which IMO it looks like they will this week, I think seeing 1 high volume green candle on VZ daily chart will confirm the breakout.
* Analyst estimates range from $47-55 for the year, I think it could start climbing into that range soon. When VZ rallies, it tends to rally 10-20% over a couple of weeks. Depending on where you measure the pennant pole, the target would be from \~$50-$55.

I think if there is anything that causes people to seek shelter outside of the bond market, which has been struggling lately, VZ is a prime candidate, and from a technical analysis perspective, it looks primed to rally hard.

Do what you will with this information. Godspeed regards!

Ps. The stock doesn't ""only"" rally when tech ETFs sink, it just happens to correlate with those declines a lot of the time.",https://i.redd.it/orw0m6zjus5f1.png,1749430657.0,0,147,wallstreetbets

Like yeah, consumer data looks weak, retail earnings are trash, housing is soft  cool we get it. That’s been true for months  But have you actually looked at what moves the market right now?  


Big tech is absolutely ripping  AI isn’t some future fantasy  it’s real spend, real revenue, real margins. Nvda adds $300B in a week, Msft printing, Goog melting up  even Apple finally waking up. That’s literally half the index. And people think the S&P’s just gonna collapse? Lmao  


Every week I see the same doom porn  credit cracks, recession lurking, “this time it’s different”  and yet price action doesn’t care. You know why? Because when stuff does start breaking, the Fed eases. They don’t want a crash heading into an election year. They’ll pivot the second things get messy  
And the fear over rising delinquencies… yeah no kidding. What did you think would happen after the fastest hiking cycle in 40 years? Obviously credit gets tight. But this isn’t 2008. Unemployment is still under 4%, corporate balance sheets are solid, and the system isn’t imploding Chill  


The market’s not pricing in perfection. It’s pricing in “slightly less bad” and “maybe we get cuts”. Yields are easing, buybacks are rolling, and there’s no alternative that yields 30% YTD like $Qqq. Money has to go somewhere  


Truth is, most of you are still traumatized from 2022. You don’t trust green candles. You assume every rip is a bull trap. But markets don’t crash when everyone’s scared. They crash when everyone’s dancing on tables. Right now? Everyone’s still hiding in T-bills and buying puts  
You really think the S&P dumps while Apple is buying back stock like it’s a religion and boomers are auto-buying every paycheck? Come on  


And don’t even get me started on the Fed Powell’s out here praying the soft landing meme becomes real. They’re not raising again. They’re literally looking for a reason to cut. Give them one more bad payroll print and they’ll have the press release ready  
But sure, let me go sell all my longs and load puts because Starbucks missed same-store sales by 1.2%. Brilliant.

TSLA,1l4e6mf,Perfectly Timed Tesla Puts (Gain and DD),"Regards Retards,

Gonna try to keep this short.  I am writing this as a Tesla owner (love that car) and former Tesla bull.  I actually bought Tesla shares the day after the election, but then sold them at $385 for the initial $14,659.15 gain.  

When the Doge problems started being apparent, I started buying puts, hit the downslope decently from above $300 to the $240s.  Got out pre earnings to avoid IV crush and because for some reason TSLA always moons on earnings no matter how bad they are.  +\~$32K  
  
Last week, I started to get that itch again thinking, man TSLA is gonna go down again...didn't have any position...was thinking about it.  Then, as soon as Elon walked into the Oval Office with that black eye, I was literally tripping all over myself on both the phone and CPU to buy puts.  I think I got in at about 360 - 355 for the 7/11 dated puts, but TSLA was dropping fast as I was buying those.    
  
Then there was today, which was just amazing.  The stuff that dreams are made of.  Chef's kiss.  
  
Degenernates, it is my hypothesis that this is not over.  Tesla can go much, much, much lower.  Setting aside the ridiculous valuation, declining sales, and toxic brand.  The biggest asset that Tesla had, it's closeness to the Whitehouse, is now its biggest liability.  The US government can hurt TSLA in so many ways:  

* TSLA is operating under numerous Federal and State level permits that can come under scrutiny 
* Just yesterday, I watched a video of an FSD Tesla tragically unalive a pedestrian, might the company face criminal liability? (BTW they should call it F\*\*king Scary Driving, I've tried it out, no way am I getting in a Robotaxi) 
* Elon Musk has regularly done things (tweeting, self-dealing) that could warrant SEC investigations 
* Elon Musk could easily be picked up on drug charges

Anyway, I wanted to get this out in case anyone is still holding: **Sell. Right now.** After-hours, pre-market, doesn’t matter — just sell.  Some bigger fool will still give you 280, but only today.  There is no reason for a bounce. The meme lords will not ride in to save you. Don’t let sunk cost fallacy wipe you out.  There is no floor here. This stock is facing a fiscal and regulatory apocalypse with no edge and no center.

AS,1l7wetd,Should you buy the dip? I analyzed all S&P 500 companies to find what happens if we only invest in companies undergoing drawdowns.,"To test, I picked all the companies in the S&P 500 list as of 2015. The backtest is simple— If a company drops by 50%, we invest $100 in that company and then hold.

I immediately ran into an issue. Out of the 502 companies on the list, 262 companies experienced a drawdown of more than 50% over the last 10 years. If you end up investing in all of them, your average return will be comparable to the index since you are holding half the index. *(Average return of 114% for the drawdown portfolio vs. 123% for the S&P 500).*

**Where it gets interesting is when we increase the drawdown cutoffs.**

# Drawdown cutoff — 75%

* Number of stocks: 91
* Total amount of investment: $9,500
* Drawdown portfolio final value (June’25): $23,903 **(151% return)**

As you would expect, investing in companies that had significant drawdowns would be highly volatile. After all, a stock that went down 90% can again go down another 90%!

Buy and hold seems to be the best strategy, as there would be many multi-baggers..

Little background: 
Company founded 2016 and was initially traded on the Austrian market . Moved to Nasdaq in 2023 and had a great run. Around Dec 2024 short seller Hindenburg research put out a hit piece and the stock dumped hard from Nov 24 to April 25. I posted on other sub Reddit about this stock when I sold some of my pltr gains and put it into this. it got very little traction 🤷‍♂️ but whatever people don’t want to make money thats on them . Good news I think she still has some left in the tank and am letting the house money ride after pulling out a bit of the gains at the start of this month and regretting it ever since. 

Why it’s worth a look now:
1) BNPL booming with younger generations and anyone with no money (aka most of us)

2)improving financials  with positive cash flow in the last earnings call looking good .

3) if consolidation occurs in this space Sezzle looks like a prime choice for a big player. 

4)MOST IMPORTANT POINT Sezzle used to be a Twolves floor sponsor and are currently the jersey sponsor. Thats a big D move . 

5) strong insider ownership ~53% last time I checked yahoo finance. 

6) jimmy chill said sell on Sezzle a few weeks ago on his lighting round seems like a good inverse Kramer play. I foolishly took some off and regretted but I was trying to not let the position be more than 20-25% of my over all holdings. 

TLDR : I think there are multiple player in fintech that have good times ahead .

AS,1l736uz,Why Sweetgreen Is Undervalued,"So here’s my honest take on why I think Sweetgreen is undervalued compared to where it’s heading in the future. For some context, I’ve been slowly accumulating shares since February 21st, 2023, with my first buy being 106 shares at $9.38. I currently hold 3,194.055 shares at an average cost of $23.66—which is about $9.61 higher than where the stock is trading today.

Anyway, here’s what I think is going right for Sweetgreen right now, and what’s not going so great:


What’s Going Well

1. Rewards Program Rolling Out Nicely
They just launched a new rewards program that gives 10 points for every $1 spent—and they’re signing up 20,000 new members a week. This is huge because it’ll let them target offers by customer segment and even individually, which is something that’s worked really well for other fast-casual chains to drive better same-store sales and revenue growth.

2. Infinite Kitchen Expansion = Big Efficiency Gains
They’re on track to open 40 new stores this year, and at least 20 of those will be the new Infinite Kitchen format. Plus, they’ll be opening their first Infinite Kitchen with a drive-thru, which could be a big deal down the road—drive-thrus are super competitive but also super profitable if you do them right.

The Infinite Kitchen is already showing big improvements—like around 700 basis points in margin boost mostly from labor savings, plus a potential 100 basis point COGS improvement. That’s at least 7 percentage points from labor and 1 point from COGS compared to similar stores without the tech.

The first Infinite Kitchen store hit a 26% restaurant-level margin in its first full month—that’s way better than the 20.4% average across the chain at the time. Less staff, more accuracy, faster service. Huge win.

3. Right Target Customer
Millennials and Gen Z are their core customer base—which is perfect because these groups really care about health, sustainability, transparency… everything Sweetgreen leans into. Together they make up like 43% of the U.S. population. Long-term this is the group you want.

4. Revenue Still Growing Despite Everything
Even with all the macro headwinds, fires in California (where a lot of their stores are), reduced marketing, and seasonal menu pullbacks, they’re still growing revenue at over 15% year-over-year. That’s not bad considering everything going on.


Valuation is Dirt Cheap Compared to Peers…

Here’s the kicker no one seems to be talking about—Sweetgreen is dirt cheap compared to the comps.

Right now they trade at a 2.1x EV/FY 2025 revenue multiple. That’s less than half of Chipotle’s valuation, and below Cava and even McDonald’s—who’s also struggling to grow same-store sales right now.

Their guidance says they’ll end FY 2025 with 286 stores (adding 40 this year), which puts their valuation at around $5.5 million EV per store. Chipotle is sitting at $16.2 million EV per store (with over 4,000 stores expected by year-end).

So yeah—Sweetgreen stores are underperforming right now. But the top-line pressure is mostly macro-related (stuff that should pass) and the margin squeeze should ease as they roll out more Infinite Kitchens.

For long-term investors willing to wait this out, this is a super cheap stock on both a revenue and per-store basis.


What’s Not Going So Well

1. Same-Store Sales Took a Hit
Q1 2025 was rough—same-store sales dropped 3.1%, which was the first negative comp since their IPO in 2021. People are spending less on discretionary stuff, and the fast-casual space is super competitive right now.

But I honestly think this is a temporary issue—they’re in a weird transition period with the loyalty program, there were the California wildfires, and they pulled back seasonal menu items. My guess is by the back half of the year, comps will be back on track.

2. Portion Size Complaints = Real Problem
This one is more anecdotal but I’ve spent some time (probably way too much time) digging through social media and reviews—and there’s a common theme: people think portions are small for the price they’re paying. Price per calorie is way worse than competitors and that’s something they really need to fix if they want loyal, repeat customers.

The Infinite Kitchen should help with this since everything is measured perfectly—but honestly I’m surprised these places don’t have like portioning spoons or scales for proteins to make sure staff isn’t shorting people. Seems like such an easy win.

3. Can They Get Loyalty Members to Come Back More Often?
20,000 new signups a week is great—but if those people don’t come back more often, it won’t matter. They need to find a way to get those new members hooked and visiting more frequently. If they do, same-store sales could pop big time.


Why I’m Still Super Bullish

Look, despite all this, I think Sweetgreen has a shot to 10x in the next 5–10 years, which would get them to an $18–20 billion market cap. That’s not crazy when you look at Chipotle sitting at $70B and Cava at $10B.

Plus, they’ve got tons of optionality left—new menu stuff, handheld items, healthy fountain drinks like kombucha (super high margin). This is a company going through a rough patch, but I think they’ll come out the other side way stronger.

AS,1l628m7,why GOOGL (Alphabet) is a great buy right now,"With WWDC and the Robotaxi event next week, I'd like to discuss Google and its parent company Alphabet, they have been in trouble for a while now regarding some bullshit anti-trust cases, and I want to tell you why its pure FUD.  Google has really caught up with the rest of the Mag 7 giants in their AI advancements if you haven't noticed.  They have been doing AI machine learning since 2001.  Bard was unimpressive, but that was only little over a year ago.  The speed at which they have been making new advancements is almost hard to track (even across other LLM's).

Have you tried Gemini?  VEO 3 costs 250/m and people are loving it. (the rev. from that will be great as well) and the new AI mode for search seems to finally have been embraced and I think they can actually leverage AI to better serve people the right business ads / referrals.  ***Either way they are monetizing AI***\*...\*

Regarding all the FUD, I dont believe the judge can make them sell chrome, EU case is just stupid, the whole thing is about them having monopoly on search and ads...  well there is Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo, Perplexity, Meta / Instagram business Ads, etc..  they have no monopoly anymore if there was one...

I dont believe the cases will result in anything materially bad for the stock but nobody can be sure, so that is why I want to dig into the Fundmental and Technical Analysis.

# ----------- Fundamentals -----------

Alphabet is a massive conglomerate with many subsidiaries.  Lets talk about how they are competing and kicking ass in so many different industries.

\-

**AI:**  

*VEO 3, AI Mode, Gemini, DeepMind* \- Competing with GPT pro, Microsoft, etc.  (note VEO 3 is still the only model that does text to video PLUS audio.  I think they leveraged youtube for it.

**Data Centers / Internet Provider:**

\-----*Google Cloud, TPU's, Google Fiber* \-Competing with many, but their TPU's are very good for AI data centers, and google Fiber competes with internet / service providers like AT&T / Comcast / T-Mobile, etc..

**Quantum Computing:**

\------Competing with Microsoft, IBM, Rigetti, etc.

**Smart Phones:**

\------*Android, Pixel Phone* (with Gemini that kicks Siri's ass) - competing with Apple big-time

**Streaming / Ads:**

\------*Youtube & Google Ads* \- Competing with Meta and Netflix

**Smart Home / Wearables:**

\------*Nest, Fitbit,* & ***XR Glasses*** \- Competing with Amazon, Apple's announced glasses and their 'watch', Microsoft, etc.

**Autonomous Driving / UAV Delivery:**

\------***Waymo, Wing*** \- Competing with Tesla (been kicking their ass on it for a while now), GM, and yes, Amazon Air delivery.  *They also just announced another partnership with Walmart to bring more drones to over 100 stores for deliveries!*

**AI in Healthcare / Biotech:**

\------*Verily, & Calico* \- working on aging / genetics and ai in healthcare.

\-*and probably a few others i've missed..*.  but the scope of their work is clear.

\-

When you buy GOOGL you are buying the entirety of Alphabets investments.  And they are so well positioned from a fundamental and financial perspective as seen in this group of charts.  They make double nearly double the revenue of Nvidia...

[Google makes more revenue than the rest of the Mag 7, nearly double Nvidia's earnings!  the only exception of Apple which could be in jeopardy too if they dont continue to innovate.](https://preview.redd.it/i61ok3bywl5f1.png?width=1183&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab383da02f61b9d5fdc7bb71ce2bde6c7d453ac2)

Yet oddly, Google has the lowest P/E (price to earnings) ratio than the rest of the Mag 7!  That seems off if you ask me.  I believe they can take plenty of market share back in the future based on these 2 figures.

# -------- Technical Analysis --------

so now lets look at the Chart!  Because Price Action Speaks more than anything else...

I like to use Multiple Timeframes for analysis so here I have the 4 hour, daily, and weekly charts.

I know there are a lot of lines and colors, dont be scared.  The indicators I use are patterns combined with price action, fib levels, TTM squeeze, RSI and some other factors such as price gaps.

\- With RSI, above/below the 50 line tells you if momentum is bullish or bearish.  All the higher timeframes are above that 50 line indicating a potential bullish reversal.

\- With TTM it makes it easier to visualize these momentum shifts.  Right now my focus is on that Weekly chart on the bottom right - higher time frames are usually more important and it appears to be on the verge of a weekly breakout.  Now with a stock like this it could take months to reach that earnings Gap and make a new all time high.  When or If this happens depends on a lot of factors, but I am only focusing on the chart.

\- The Fibonacci Retracements I mostly use for the 50% line to determine if the price has had a change of trend.  Right now the price is attempting a breakout above this retracement and if it can break over 175 then there is plenty of room up.

\- Ive also illustrated some patterns and concepts on the chart.  Inverted Head and Shoulders, Trendline Break, Higher Highs and Higher Lows, potentially an even larger inverted H&S on the daily chart to the top right.

Ok so what does this technical analysis mumbo jumbo mean?  Its hard to say because of Trump, Tarrifs, Deals, Interest Rates, Bonds, Geopolitics, the fact that the market has already just about reached all time highs and this is lagging...  it is concerning.  It could also just be setting up for a massive (bearish) head and shoulders as you might notice on the bottom right weekly chart.

But with WWDC, RoboTaxi, and several trump deals supposedly taking place next week, we could be setup for some bullish continuation if these tech events impress.  Either way, Long Term I believe Google / Alphabet stock will get back to 200.

From a technical and fundamental perspective they are in great shape.  I would even bet that if the market pulls back, that institutions may rotate their Mag 7 holdings into the laggards such as this and Amazon.

While they are aggressively competing with so many different companies and industries, their earnings are expected to continue to grow and as you saw earlier, they earn double what Nvidia earns... Pelosi still has calls, and lets face it, you still use some kind of google product in your life whether its youtube, your android based phone, ai / gemini research, waymo, etc...  I believe Google is well positioned to be a winner this year in AI and many of its subsidiary company products.

\--------------

# TLDR:

**Alphabet is a great Bet !**

I currently am selling put credit spreads on GOOGL, and have several 180 calls for 7/18 that I only plan to hold through next week before I re-enter as there is going to be a lot going on next week for the markets.  Their earnings are on 7/22 I believe, so August may be a better strike date.  Shares or LEAPS (calls dated atleast for 2026) are also a good idea IMO, you can sell calls against them to hedge when there are large spikes.

**Anyway, I am highly regarded** ***and this is not financial advice,*** but I am very bullish on Google long term.  Its not an easy one to trade if you like short dated options, you need patience, but the chart, the p/e ratios, the incredible amount of subsidiaries competing with more than other Mag 7 companies makes this thing a highly undervalued growth & value stock.

JUNE,1l7wetd,Should you buy the dip? I analyzed all S&P 500 companies to find what happens if we only invest in companies undergoing drawdowns.,"To test, I picked all the companies in the S&P 500 list as of 2015. The backtest is simple— If a company drops by 50%, we invest $100 in that company and then hold.

I immediately ran into an issue. Out of the 502 companies on the list, 262 companies experienced a drawdown of more than 50% over the last 10 years. If you end up investing in all of them, your average return will be comparable to the index since you are holding half the index. *(Average return of 114% for the drawdown portfolio vs. 123% for the S&P 500).*

**Where it gets interesting is when we increase the drawdown cutoffs.**

# Drawdown cutoff — 75%

* Number of stocks: 91
* Total amount of investment: $9,500
* Drawdown portfolio final value (June’25): $23,903 **(151% return)**
* Comparable S&P 500 index: $20,467 **(115% return)**

# Best and worst performers

As you would expect, investing in companies that had significant drawdowns would be highly volatile. After all, a stock that went down 90% can again go down another 90%!

Buy and hold seems to be the best strategy, as there would be many multi-baggers..

JUNE,1l37l3m,1.3m $RDDT Bet - Too Many Ways to Win,"[YOLO my retirement](https://preview.redd.it/b79sltwwbx4f1.png?width=2762&format=png&auto=webp&s=2da693c6e85ac91a950290dc6ef77677fb3fb36b)

**TL;DR:** Reddit is massively under monetized compared to peers (ARPU of $3.63 vs Meta's $12+), but sitting on the internet's highest quality dataset for AI training. They're already making $100M+ annually from OpenAI/Google at 90%+ margins, with new revenue streams emerging (hedge fund data via ICE, premium subreddits targeting the creator economy). Management has proven they can monetize without killing the community. Multiple ways to win (ARPU growth, data licensing expansion, creator monetization).

Thesis: Reddit is the last major platform with truly authentic, human driven conten and every dollar they make from data, ads, or subscriptions flows almost entirely to the bottom line. That combination (community moat + 90% margins + under monetized user base) means there are tons of ways for shareholders to win.

**Moat/Why Reddit Matters**

Reddit’s value is in its data. Unlike algorithmic feeds that amplify engagement optimized content, Reddit's community moderated format naturally filters for substantive discussion through upvoting and downvoting mechanisms. This creates a self curating dataset where quality content rises organically. Reddit's niche communities offer domain expertise at scale. Subreddits such as r/AskHistorians or r/PersonalFinance provide high quality, contextual knowledge that is hard to find elsewhere. While other platforms deal with increasing bot activity and AI generated content pollution, Reddit's community moderation creates natural quality controls. Compare this to Meta or Twitter, where content moderation costs eat into margins. Reddit's community does the curation work for free, then Reddit monetizes that curation.

 

That makes Reddit a data goldmine for LLMs.

This creates a flywheel of engagement that’s not only sticky for users but incredibly valuable to AI and advertisers.

* Reddit is already pulling in \~$100M/year from data licensing deals with OpenAI and Google.
* That revenue flows almost entirely to the bottom line, pushing gross margins >90%.
* Unlike ad reliant platforms, this is pure margin, recurring revenue.
* Reddit has content tagged by subreddit leading to specific and niche domain knowledge which is super valuable for AI training. 

**The CEO and Why Management Can Execute** 

Steve Huffman cofounded Reddit in 2005 but left in 2009 to pursue his own startup journey. At Hipmunk, he gained hands on experience with the monetization challenges Reddit would eventually face: negotiating ad partnerships, building affiliate revenue streams, and learning how to balance aggressive growth targets with maintaining user trust skills that weren't part of his original toolkit as a pure product founder.

When Huffman returned as CEO in 2015, Reddit was stagnant, 

traffic growth had slowed, leadership was paralyzed by fear of change, and basic revenue infrastructure was missing. But he now brought a different perspective, having personally wrestled with the complexities of turning user engagement into sustainable revenue.

His turnaround demonstrates he can execute on complex monetization without destroying community value. He overhauled the interface, built mobile functionality, and completely revamped Reddit's ad offerings. More importantly, he implemented content policies and moderator tools that preserved Reddit's authentic culture while making it advertiser friendly.

This experience matters for the opportunities ahead premium subreddits, expanded data licensing, international ARPU growth because they all require the same delicate balance Huffman learned through his entrepreneurial journey: extracting maximum revenue from unique community assets without killing what makes them valuable.

**Growth Catalysts**

**ARPU Tailwinds vs. Facebook/Google/Meta**

Reddit’s ARPU is currently well below its peers and management is actively working on closing the gap.

Current ARPU Gap:

* US ARPU: $6.21 (+31% YoY)
* Intl ARPU: $1.34 (\~5× lower than US)
* Global ARPU: $3.63 (+23% YoY)
* Google Benchmark: Google Services generated $77.3 b in Q1 2025 (including $50.7 b search), with €6.35 p/m in Europe (\~$76 per year).
* Meta Benchmark: Meta’s ARPP was $10.42 per user in Q1 2025 (\~$12.36 TTM).

If Reddit can even approach half of Meta’s or Google’s yield in key markets, ARPU can more than double from here. When Reddit doubles ARPU from $3.63 to \~$7, you're looking at revenue growth with 90%+ gross margins. Even with zero DAU growth, that's \~$3B in annual revenue. Add conservative 20% DAU growth to 130M users, and you're approaching $3.6B in revenue. Right now Reddit’s market cap is 20B with the potential to generate $500M+ in quarterly free cash flow at those levels. And here is how they are going to do it. 

To increase ARPU Reddit is rolling out:

1. New ad formats (video, search, shopping) & better targeting & analytics for advertisers
2. AI powered content recommendations (already +30% in “Good Visits”)
3. Global machine translation (30+ countries)

I’m unsure if Reddit Answers will move the needle but it shows that the team is shipping fast and not afraid to experiment. 

**Emerging Data Monetization Beyond AI Training**

Reddit is now piloting financial data products through ICE, selling real time sentiment analysis and trend identification to hedge funds. This presents another new potential revenue stream. While still early stage, the addressable market for financial sentiment data is enormous. If Reddit can demonstrate alpha generation from their community discussions, institutional demand could create substantial revenue. Reddit's threaded discussions and voting mechanisms create cleaner sentiment signals than traditional social media noise. If Reddit can prove their data moves markets, they're looking at potentially hundreds of millions in annual recurring revenue from the finance vertical alone.

The speculative angle is whether other industries (healthcare sentiment, brand monitoring, political analysis) follow suit once Reddit demonstrates the model works with financial services.

**The Trump Call**

Anger is the most contagious emotion, and Trump makes people furious, which translates directly to engagement and revenue. During Trump's 2017-2021 term, NYT stock tripled (+227%) on the back of outrage fueled subscription growth, proving that political chaos drives monetizable engagement. Reddit thrives in this environment even more than traditional media. The platform's political subreddits already drive massive traffic during controversies r/politics regularly dominates the front page during major news cycles, and angry users spend significantly more time on platform, driving ad revenue and engagement metrics. As Trump continues generating daily headlines and controversies, Reddit becomes the primary destination for realtime discussion and debate. Unlike passive news consumption, Reddit's format encourages users to engage, argue, and scroll for hours through comment threads. This sustained engagement during Trump's presidency should provide a meaningful tailwind for both user growth and time spent on the platform, directly benefiting Reddit's advertising revenue and data value.

**Premium Subreddits**

Right now, NSFW content creators are farming engagement on Reddit for free, then redirecting traffic off platform to make money elsewhere. Reddit sees none of that profit. Reddit has explicitly discussed that they are working on premium subreddits. This keeps users on platform, and skims off that monetization by allowing creators to monetize directly on platform, with Reddit taking a platform fee.

Think OnlyFans creators paying Reddit a cut instead of just leeching traffic. This represents 100% incremental revenue with virtually zero marginal cost to Reddit as they're already hosting the content and communities.

OnlyFans generated $6.6 billion in gross payments volume in 2023, translating to $1.3 billion in revenue at a 20% take rate and $657 million in pretax profit. If Reddit's premium subreddit model can capture even a small fraction of this creator economy by leveraging their existing massive NSFW user base and superior community features it could substantially add to their revenue mix.

**Near Term Catalysts**

Reddit faces several key institutional milestones that could drive significant passive capital inflows. Russell 1000/3000 inclusion is scheduled for June 27, 2025, after market close, which should trigger automatic buying from index tracking funds starting that Friday. More significantly, if Reddit maintains its current profitability trajectory and scale, S&P 500 eligibility could arrive by mid 2026. The company's Annual Investor Day on June 9, 2025. I’m unsure if anything will serve as a catalyst for anything I’ve mentioned here but I’m excited to hear what their team is working on. 

**The Google Risk and Why It Doesn’t Matter**

Reddit’s top line still depends heavily on Google’s search algorithm, so whenever Google tweaks its ranking, Reddit’s traffic and revenue can swing. After Reddit reported Q4 2024 results in late February, the stock sold off sharply when search rankings dipped. The same thing happened in May, despite a strong Q1 2025 beat (year over year revenue up 47%). On the Q1 call, Steve Huffman cautioned that “growth will be bumpy,” noting that April daily active user growth slowed to 17%. Then the stock gave up its gains.

In reality, those monthly fluctuations don’t change the bigger picture: Reddit is still adding users and monetizing them at a fast clip. Short term search volatility simply means revenue and growth will be bumpy, but the overall trend remains squarely upward. The market is overplaying Reddit’s “Google dependency”. Even with occasional dips, Reddit’s growth trajectory is intact. Ignore the volatility and focus on the overall trajectory. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1l37l3m/13m_rddt_bet_too_many_ways_to_win/,1749048784.0,865,333,wallstreetbets

I was very excited about this company's potential (and still am, see below), but had ultimately exited most of my OKLO positions early in the new year as I had feared a major general pullback once Trump admin got going.

GOOD,1l7ccch,Fintech seems like it could have legs for a while and SEZL will be my dark horse for this year and beyond.,"I will keep this short  as no one wants another AI generated dumpster fire . Yes i have a position see photos , all shares no calls which is a bummer. 

Little background: 
Company founded 2016 and was initially traded on the Austrian market . Moved to Nasdaq in 2023 and had a great run. Around Dec 2024 short seller Hindenburg research put out a hit piece and the stock dumped hard from Nov 24 to April 25. I posted on other sub Reddit about this stock when I sold some of my pltr gains and put it into this. it got very little traction 🤷‍♂️ but whatever people don’t want to make money thats on them . Good news I think she still has some left in the tank and am letting the house money ride after pulling out a bit of the gains at the start of this month and regretting it ever since. 

Why it’s worth a look now:
1) BNPL booming with younger generations and anyone with no money (aka most of us)

2)improving financials  with positive cash flow in the last earnings call looking good .

3) if consolidation occurs in this space Sezzle looks like a prime choice for a big player. 

4)MOST IMPORTANT POINT Sezzle used to be a Twolves floor sponsor and are currently the jersey sponsor. Thats a big D move . 

5) strong insider ownership ~53% last time I checked yahoo finance. 

6) jimmy chill said sell on Sezzle a few weeks ago on his lighting round seems like a good inverse Kramer play. I foolishly took some off and regretted but I was trying to not let the position be more than 20-25% of my over all holdings. 

TLDR : I think there are multiple player in fintech that have good times ahead .

GOOD,1l628m7,why GOOGL (Alphabet) is a great buy right now,"With WWDC and the Robotaxi event next week, I'd like to discuss Google and its parent company Alphabet, they have been in trouble for a while now regarding some bullshit anti-trust cases, and I want to tell you why its pure FUD.  Google has really caught up with the rest of the Mag 7 giants in their AI advancements if you haven't noticed.  They have been doing AI machine learning since 2001.  Bard was unimpressive, but that was only little over a year ago.  The speed at which they have been making new advancements is almost hard to track (even across other LLM's).

Have you tried Gemini?  VEO 3 costs 250/m and people are loving it. (the rev. from that will be great as well) and the new AI mode for search seems to finally have been embraced and I think they can actually leverage AI to better serve people the right business ads / referrals.  ***Either way they are monetizing AI***\*...\*

Regarding all the FUD, I dont believe the judge can make them sell chrome, EU case is just stupid, the whole thing is about them having monopoly on search and ads...  well there is Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo, Perplexity, Meta / Instagram business Ads, etc..  they have no monopoly anymore if there was one...

I dont believe the cases will result in anything materially bad for the stock but nobody can be sure, so that is why I want to dig into the Fundmental and Technical Analysis.

# ----------- Fundamentals -----------

Alphabet is a massive conglomerate with many subsidiaries.  Lets talk about how they are competing and kicking ass in so many different industries.

\-

**AI:**  

*VEO 3, AI Mode, Gemini, DeepMind* \- Competing with GPT pro, Microsoft, etc.  (note VEO 3 is still the only model that does text to video PLUS audio.  I think they leveraged youtube for it.

**Data Centers / Internet Provider:**

\-----*Google Cloud, TPU's, Google Fiber* \-Competing with many, but their TPU's are very good for AI data centers, and google Fiber competes with internet / service providers like AT&T / Comcast / T-Mobile, etc..

**Quantum Computing:**

\------Competing with Microsoft, IBM, Rigetti, etc.

**Smart Phones:**

\------*Android, Pixel Phone* (with Gemini that kicks Siri's ass) - competing with Apple big-time

**Streaming / Ads:**

\------*Youtube & Google Ads* \- Competing with Meta and Netflix

**Smart Home / Wearables:**

\------*Nest, Fitbit,* & ***XR Glasses*** \- Competing with Amazon, Apple's announced glasses and their 'watch', Microsoft, etc.

**Autonomous Driving / UAV Delivery:**

\------***Waymo, Wing*** \- Competing with Tesla (been kicking their ass on it for a while now), GM, and yes, Amazon Air delivery.  *They also just announced another partnership with Walmart to bring more drones to over 100 stores for deliveries!*

**AI in Healthcare / Biotech:**

\------*Verily, & Calico* \- working on aging / genetics and ai in healthcare.

\-*and probably a few others i've missed..*.  but the scope of their work is clear.

\-

When you buy GOOGL you are buying the entirety of Alphabets investments.  And they are so well positioned from a fundamental and financial perspective as seen in this group of charts.  They make double nearly double the revenue of Nvidia...

[Google makes more revenue than the rest of the Mag 7, nearly double Nvidia's earnings!  the only exception of Apple which could be in jeopardy too if they dont continue to innovate.](https://preview.redd.it/i61ok3bywl5f1.png?width=1183&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab383da02f61b9d5fdc7bb71ce2bde6c7d453ac2)

\-

Yet oddly, Google has the lowest P/E (price to earnings) ratio than the rest of the Mag 7!  That seems off if you ask me.  I believe they can take plenty of market share back in the future based on these 2 figures.

https://preview.redd.it/a61jyxhzwl5f1.png?width=1125&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b85188b91cd7b2b6b95516e18513586d86d630b

# -------- Technical Analysis --------

so now lets look at the Chart!  Because Price Action Speaks more than anything else...

I like to use Multiple Timeframes for analysis so here I have the 4 hour, daily, and weekly charts.

I know there are a lot of lines and colors, dont be scared.  The indicators I use are patterns combined with price action, fib levels, TTM squeeze, RSI and some other factors such as price gaps.

\- With RSI, above/below the 50 line tells you if momentum is bullish or bearish.  All the higher timeframes are above that 50 line indicating a potential bullish reversal.

\- With TTM it makes it easier to visualize these momentum shifts.  Right now my focus is on that Weekly chart on the bottom right - higher time frames are usually more important and it appears to be on the verge of a weekly breakout.  Now with a stock like this it could take months to reach that earnings Gap and make a new all time high.  When or If this happens depends on a lot of factors, but I am only focusing on the chart.

\- The Fibonacci Retracements I mostly use for the 50% line to determine if the price has had a change of trend.  Right now the price is attempting a breakout above this retracement and if it can break over 175 then there is plenty of room up.

\- Ive also illustrated some patterns and concepts on the chart.  Inverted Head and Shoulders, Trendline Break, Higher Highs and Higher Lows, potentially an even larger inverted H&S on the daily chart to the top right.

https://preview.redd.it/d2fprue33m5f1.jpg?width=3676&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=77f0a1e390e7b81ec6f893f6f38220ffc3fde21f

Ok so what does this technical analysis mumbo jumbo mean?  Its hard to say because of Trump, Tarrifs, Deals, Interest Rates, Bonds, Geopolitics, the fact that the market has already just about reached all time highs and this is lagging...  it is concerning.  It could also just be setting up for a massive (bearish) head and shoulders as you might notice on the bottom right weekly chart.

But with WWDC, RoboTaxi, and several trump deals supposedly taking place next week, we could be setup for some bullish continuation if these tech events impress.  Either way, Long Term I believe Google / Alphabet stock will get back to 200.

From a technical and fundamental perspective they are in great shape.  I would even bet that if the market pulls back, that institutions may rotate their Mag 7 holdings into the laggards such as this and Amazon.

While they are aggressively competing with so many different companies and industries, their earnings are expected to continue to grow and as you saw earlier, they earn double what Nvidia earns... Pelosi still has calls, and lets face it, you still use some kind of google product in your life whether its youtube, your android based phone, ai / gemini research, waymo, etc...  I believe Google is well positioned to be a winner this year in AI and many of its subsidiary company products.

\--------------

# TLDR:

**Alphabet is a great Bet !**

I currently am selling put credit spreads on GOOGL, and have several 180 calls for 7/18 that I only plan to hold through next week before I re-enter as there is going to be a lot going on next week for the markets.  Their earnings are on 7/22 I believe, so August may be a better strike date.  Shares or LEAPS (calls dated atleast for 2026) are also a good idea IMO, you can sell calls against them to hedge when there are large spikes.

**Anyway, I am highly regarded** ***and this is not financial advice,*** but I am very bullish on Google long term.  Its not an easy one to trade if you like short dated options, you need patience, but the chart, the p/e ratios, the incredible amount of subsidiaries competing with more than other Mag 7 companies makes this thing a highly undervalued growth & value stock.

*Price Target short term - 180*

*Price Target long term - 200+*

Like yeah, consumer data looks weak, retail earnings are trash, housing is soft  cool we get it. That’s been true for months  But have you actually looked at what moves the market right now?  


Big tech is absolutely ripping  AI isn’t some future fantasy  it’s real spend, real revenue, real margins. Nvda adds $300B in a week, Msft printing, Goog melting up  even Apple finally waking up. That’s literally half the index. And people think the S&P’s just gonna collapse? Lmao  


Every week I see the same doom porn  credit cracks, recession lurking, “this time it’s different”  and yet price action doesn’t care. You know why? Because when stuff does start breaking, the Fed eases. They don’t want a crash heading into an election year. They’ll pivot the second things get messy  
And the fear over rising delinquencies… yeah no kidding. What did you think would happen after the fastest hiking cycle in 40 years? Obviously credit gets tight. But this isn’t 2008. Unemployment is still under 4%, corporate balance sheets are solid, and the system isn’t imploding Chill  


The market’s not pricing in perfection. It’s pricing in “slightly less bad” and “maybe we get cuts”. Yields are easing, buybacks are rolling, and there’s no alternative that yields 30% YTD like $Qqq. Money has to go somewhere  


Truth is, most of you are still traumatized from 2022. You don’t trust green candles. You assume every rip is a bull trap. But markets don’t crash when everyone’s scared. They crash when everyone’s dancing on tables. Right now? Everyone’s still hiding in T-bills and buying puts  
You really think the S&P dumps while Apple is buying back stock like it’s a religion and boomers are auto-buying every paycheck? Come on  


And don’t even get me started on the Fed Powell’s out here praying the soft landing meme becomes real. They’re not raising again. They’re literally looking for a reason to cut. Give them one more bad payroll print and they’ll have the press release ready

Pelosi still has calls, and lets face it, you still use some kind of google product in your life whether its youtube, your android based phone, ai / gemini research, waymo, etc...  I believe Google is well positioned to be a winner this year in AI and many of its subsidiary company products.

\--------------

# TLDR:

**Alphabet is a great Bet !**

I currently am selling put credit spreads on GOOGL, and have several 180 calls for 7/18 that I only plan to hold through next week before I re-enter as there is going to be a lot going on next week for the markets.  Their earnings are on 7/22 I believe, so August may be a better strike date.  Shares or LEAPS (calls dated atleast for 2026) are also a good idea IMO, you can sell calls against them to hedge when there are large spikes.

**Anyway, I am highly regarded** ***and this is not financial advice,*** but I am very bullish on Google long term.  Its not an easy one to trade if you like short dated options, you need patience, but the chart, the p/e ratios, the incredible amount of subsidiaries competing with more than other Mag 7 companies makes this thing a highly undervalued growth & value stock.

*Price Target short term - 180*

*Price Target long term - 200+*

Your boy hit $PLTR big, and sized up with $NET now.

I work with Cloudflare every day, and IMO Wall Street is sleeping on what this company is about to pull off.

Everyone’s busy throwing money at $NVDA and $PLTR, but $NET is perfectly positioned to be one of the biggest beneficiaries in the AI boom and no one is pricing it in.

Here’s why:

* Cloudflare isn’t just a CDN or DDoS shield — it’s becoming the backbone of the internet
* They’re rolling out serverless compute (Workers), AI inference at the edge, and building a network that can scale globally faster and cheaper than the cloud giants.
* AI workloads need fast, secure, distributed infra — exactly what Cloudflare specializes in.
* Partnerships with OpenAI, Hugging Face, NVIDIA, etc., are flying under the radar.

$NET has been quietly building a moat, and when the market wakes up, it’s going to rip faces off.

Yes I am talking about the thing you have in the junk drawer:

I am a senior level IC at a FAANG and deal with AI regularly and I only buy stocks in things I deal with and understand.

I looked into this when my wife came home with the wrong type of thumb drive for her stupid Macbook (a Sandisk that requires a USB - thank you Apple for removing those fucking ports on everything). Was curious if this was a company I could short and then learned what they were doing. Now I think this is a sleeper pick that nobody's really paying attention to.

**Product deep dive:**

* NVIDIA certified Sandisk’s Gen5 eSSDs for datacenter use. Certification means they're officially in the vendor chain for AI servers.
* Additionally, they've also built something called High Bandwidth Flash (HBF) which is a new memory architecture built for massive memory capacity and throughput (important for AI). Nobody else is making this and it's developed in-house (one of the main reasons I bought).
* Sandisk is shipping one of the most power-efficient flash technologies available right now, BiCS8.
* Cloud sales—12% of Sandisk’s total output went to AWS/GCP/Azure this quarter, up from 8% a year ago. My employer is one of these and our AI spend is essentially a blank check. It's kind of an arms race right now.
* AI spend isn't going to stop. I work in a part of a FAANG where we're seeing complete transformation plans to overhaul our customer-facing service into an AI-heavy experience. Yes a lot of companies are bleeding money on this but a lot aren't. I see the sales numbers and the internal productivity boost we've gotten is insane.

**Brand shift:**

Yes they do still make consumer stuff. But IGAF about thumb drives sold at Walmart. What they are building gives them a seat at the table for large AI-related deals.

**Earnings TLDR:**

* Revenue: $1.7B
* Adjusted free cash flow: $220M
* Cash on hand: $1.5B
* Forecast: demand strengthening through year-end
* Gross margin took a hit (22.7%), but they’re working on it through pricing and cost controls

This was their first full quarter as a standalone company after separating from Western Digital. Still early.

**Other areas they’re moving into:**

* **EV**: Flash tech being used for autonomous driving, just nominated Ford Supplier of the Year. NOTE: I am not an EV person and haven't really gone down this rabbit hole. I'm just looking into the AI side.
* **Gaming**: Their new SSDs are winning “Best Of” awards
* **Content creation**: Rolled out pro-grade memory cards and high-performance portable SSDs

**Risks:**

* Gross margins were down this quarter—mostly due to pricing pressure and the usual NAND volatility
* Consumer segment is still soft
* Goodwill impairment made GAAP numbers ugly (-$1.8B), though this was non-cash and tied to the separation
* This is absolutely a lotto play.
* Thin options liquidity. I just got shares.

AI,1l37l3m,1.3m $RDDT Bet - Too Many Ways to Win,"[YOLO my retirement](https://preview.redd.it/b79sltwwbx4f1.png?width=2762&format=png&auto=webp&s=2da693c6e85ac91a950290dc6ef77677fb3fb36b)

**TL;DR:** Reddit is massively under monetized compared to peers (ARPU of $3.63 vs Meta's $12+), but sitting on the internet's highest quality dataset for AI training. They're already making $100M+ annually from OpenAI/Google at 90%+ margins, with new revenue streams emerging (hedge fund data via ICE, premium subreddits targeting the creator economy). Management has proven they can monetize without killing the community. Multiple ways to win (ARPU growth, data licensing expansion, creator monetization).

Thesis: Reddit is the last major platform with truly authentic, human driven conten and every dollar they make from data, ads, or subscriptions flows almost entirely to the bottom line. That combination (community moat + 90% margins + under monetized user base) means there are tons of ways for shareholders to win.

**Moat/Why Reddit Matters**

Reddit’s value is in its data. Unlike algorithmic feeds that amplify engagement optimized content, Reddit's community moderated format naturally filters for substantive discussion through upvoting and downvoting mechanisms. This creates a self curating dataset where quality content rises organically. Reddit's niche communities offer domain expertise at scale. Subreddits such as r/AskHistorians or r/PersonalFinance provide high quality, contextual knowledge that is hard to find elsewhere. While other platforms deal with increasing bot activity and AI generated content pollution, Reddit's community moderation creates natural quality controls. Compare this to Meta or Twitter, where content moderation costs eat into margins. Reddit's community does the curation work for free, then Reddit monetizes that curation.

 

That makes Reddit a data goldmine for LLMs.

This creates a flywheel of engagement that’s not only sticky for users but incredibly valuable to AI and advertisers.

* Reddit is already pulling in \~$100M/year from data licensing deals with OpenAI and Google.
* That revenue flows almost entirely to the bottom line, pushing gross margins >90%.
* Unlike ad reliant platforms, this is pure margin, recurring revenue.
* Reddit has content tagged by subreddit leading to specific and niche domain knowledge which is super valuable for AI training. 

**The CEO and Why Management Can Execute** 

Steve Huffman cofounded Reddit in 2005 but left in 2009 to pursue his own startup journey. At Hipmunk, he gained hands on experience with the monetization challenges Reddit would eventually face: negotiating ad partnerships, building affiliate revenue streams, and learning how to balance aggressive growth targets with maintaining user trust skills that weren't part of his original toolkit as a pure product founder.

When Huffman returned as CEO in 2015, Reddit was stagnant, 

traffic growth had slowed, leadership was paralyzed by fear of change, and basic revenue infrastructure was missing. But he now brought a different perspective, having personally wrestled with the complexities of turning user engagement into sustainable revenue.

His turnaround demonstrates he can execute on complex monetization without destroying community value. He overhauled the interface, built mobile functionality, and completely revamped Reddit's ad offerings. More importantly, he implemented content policies and moderator tools that preserved Reddit's authentic culture while making it advertiser friendly.

This experience matters for the opportunities ahead premium subreddits, expanded data licensing, international ARPU growth because they all require the same delicate balance Huffman learned through his entrepreneurial journey: extracting maximum revenue from unique community assets without killing what makes them valuable.

**Growth Catalysts**

**ARPU Tailwinds vs. Facebook/Google/Meta**

Reddit’s ARPU is currently well below its peers and management is actively working on closing the gap.

Current ARPU Gap:

* US ARPU: $6.21 (+31% YoY)
* Intl ARPU: $1.34 (\~5× lower than US)
* Global ARPU: $3.63 (+23% YoY)
* Google Benchmark: Google Services generated $77.3 b in Q1 2025 (including $50.7 b search), with €6.35 p/m in Europe (\~$76 per year).
* Meta Benchmark: Meta’s ARPP was $10.42 per user in Q1 2025 (\~$12.36 TTM).

If Reddit can even approach half of Meta’s or Google’s yield in key markets, ARPU can more than double from here. When Reddit doubles ARPU from $3.63 to \~$7, you're looking at revenue growth with 90%+ gross margins. Even with zero DAU growth, that's \~$3B in annual revenue. Add conservative 20% DAU growth to 130M users, and you're approaching $3.6B in revenue. Right now Reddit’s market cap is 20B with the potential to generate $500M+ in quarterly free cash flow at those levels. And here is how they are going to do it. 

To increase ARPU Reddit is rolling out:

1. New ad formats (video, search, shopping) & better targeting & analytics for advertisers
2. AI powered content recommendations (already +30% in “Good Visits”)
3. Global machine translation (30+ countries)

I’m unsure if Reddit Answers will move the needle but it shows that the team is shipping fast and not afraid to experiment. 

**Emerging Data Monetization Beyond AI Training**

Reddit is now piloting financial data products through ICE, selling real time sentiment analysis and trend identification to hedge funds. This presents another new potential revenue stream. While still early stage, the addressable market for financial sentiment data is enormous. If Reddit can demonstrate alpha generation from their community discussions, institutional demand could create substantial revenue. Reddit's threaded discussions and voting mechanisms create cleaner sentiment signals than traditional social media noise. If Reddit can prove their data moves markets, they're looking at potentially hundreds of millions in annual recurring revenue from the finance vertical alone.

The speculative angle is whether other industries (healthcare sentiment, brand monitoring, political analysis) follow suit once Reddit demonstrates the model works with financial services.

**The Trump Call**

Anger is the most contagious emotion, and Trump makes people furious, which translates directly to engagement and revenue. During Trump's 2017-2021 term, NYT stock tripled (+227%) on the back of outrage fueled subscription growth, proving that political chaos drives monetizable engagement. Reddit thrives in this environment even more than traditional media. The platform's political subreddits already drive massive traffic during controversies r/politics regularly dominates the front page during major news cycles, and angry users spend significantly more time on platform, driving ad revenue and engagement metrics. As Trump continues generating daily headlines and controversies, Reddit becomes the primary destination for realtime discussion and debate. Unlike passive news consumption, Reddit's format encourages users to engage, argue, and scroll for hours through comment threads. This sustained engagement during Trump's presidency should provide a meaningful tailwind for both user growth and time spent on the platform, directly benefiting Reddit's advertising revenue and data value.

**Premium Subreddits**

Right now, NSFW content creators are farming engagement on Reddit for free, then redirecting traffic off platform to make money elsewhere. Reddit sees none of that profit. Reddit has explicitly discussed that they are working on premium subreddits. This keeps users on platform, and skims off that monetization by allowing creators to monetize directly on platform, with Reddit taking a platform fee.

Think OnlyFans creators paying Reddit a cut instead of just leeching traffic. This represents 100% incremental revenue with virtually zero marginal cost to Reddit as they're already hosting the content and communities.

OnlyFans generated $6.6 billion in gross payments volume in 2023, translating to $1.3 billion in revenue at a 20% take rate and $657 million in pretax profit. If Reddit's premium subreddit model can capture even a small fraction of this creator economy by leveraging their existing massive NSFW user base and superior community features it could substantially add to their revenue mix.

**Near Term Catalysts**

Reddit faces several key institutional milestones that could drive significant passive capital inflows. Russell 1000/3000 inclusion is scheduled for June 27, 2025, after market close, which should trigger automatic buying from index tracking funds starting that Friday. More significantly, if Reddit maintains its current profitability trajectory and scale, S&P 500 eligibility could arrive by mid 2026. The company's Annual Investor Day on June 9, 2025. I’m unsure if anything will serve as a catalyst for anything I’ve mentioned here but I’m excited to hear what their team is working on. 

**The Google Risk and Why It Doesn’t Matter**

Reddit’s top line still depends heavily on Google’s search algorithm, so whenever Google tweaks its ranking, Reddit’s traffic and revenue can swing. After Reddit reported Q4 2024 results in late February, the stock sold off sharply when search rankings dipped. The same thing happened in May, despite a strong Q1 2025 beat (year over year revenue up 47%). On the Q1 call, Steve Huffman cautioned that “growth will be bumpy,” noting that April daily active user growth slowed to 17%. Then the stock gave up its gains.

In reality, those monthly fluctuations don’t change the bigger picture: Reddit is still adding users and monetizing them at a fast clip. Short term search volatility simply means revenue and growth will be bumpy, but the overall trend remains squarely upward. The market is overplaying Reddit’s “Google dependency”. Even with occasional dips, Reddit’s growth trajectory is intact. Ignore the volatility and focus on the overall trajectory. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1l37l3m/13m_rddt_bet_too_many_ways_to_win/,1749048784.0,858,333,wallstreetbets
AI,1l35hg0,$APLD: This ain’t a stock. It’s a launchpad. Public Pureplay on the AI Bottleneck.,"I’m long APLD.

Applied Digital is a developer of next-generation infrastructure for AI. They have two segments: (i) custom-built, high-performance data centers; and (ii) GPUs as a service. Applied is currently focused on a large 400MW data center project in Ellendale, ND, and is marketing a 1.4GW pipeline of additional capacity. Please see the company’s latest investor presentation on their website for more details. 

There is a frenzy for compute power by both hyperscalers and Fortune 500 companies, covered extensively everywhere you look. Power and datacenter capacity is the new bottleneck. Nvidia’s CEO, Jensen, has and continues to discuss the need to modernize a trillion dollars worth of data centers to tap into AI’s potential. APLD is a first mover aiming to capture this opportunity.

APLD’s history in developing power hungry crypto hosting sites in low-cost power locations was the perfect preparation for today’s AI opportunity. APLD’s foray into North Dakota for cheap electricity to fund crypto mining left the company with relationships and access to massive low cost power, low cost land with space for expansion, room for additional wind/solar farms to be integrated, state tax incentives, and cooler temperatures which are beneficial for the TCO of high density AI data centers. A healthy dose of luck contributed to locking up this opportunity, industry participants have told me you cannot underscore just how valuable this power and first mover advantage is for prospective customers. If GPUs are the pickaxes behind the AI revolution, power guys are swinging the axes.

**Unit Economics and Valuation**

**HPC Data Centers**
The rule of thumb for data centers is it costs $8-12 million per MW to build and each MW can generate ~$1mm of NOI. Applied Digital’s Ellendale campus has signed 250 MW of 15-year leases with CoreWeave, expected to generate $7 billion of total revenue over those 15 years (≈$466.7 million per year). That works out to ≈$1.867 million of revenue per MW per year. Assuming a typical HPC/data center EBITDA margin of 50–60 %, each MW will likely produce $0.9–$1.2 million of NOI per year. Therefore, the 250 MW currently under contract should yield $233–$280 million of NOI annually. At a 5–6 % cap rate, that implies an enterprise value (TEV) in the $3.9–$5.6 billion range for the signed 250 MW. If the full 400 MW build is leased at similar economics, total NOI would be $360–$480 million per year, implying TEV of $6–$9.6 billion. The remaining 150 MW of backlog could contribute up to $150 million of additional annual NOI—i.e., another $2.5–$3 billion of TEV—if signed at comparable rates. 

Locking in the 250 MW CoreWeave lease translates into roughly $3.3–$5.17b of equity, or about $15–$23 per share. Each additional 100 MW of backlog, using $0.9–$1.2 m of NOI per MW and a 5–6 % cap rate, would be worth approximately $5/share using the same math. If Applied is able to lock in 1.4GW of projects, that’s an additional $70/share of value that could be created. Haircut all of this however you prefer. The numbers can get wild.

**Applied Digital Cloud**
This segment has not been a focus for the company or the investment community recently, but is an underappreciated lotto ticket. Think of it as an early-stage CoreWeave. The business model is simple: they purchase GPUs from NVDA, install them in data centers, and lease them to customers for a fixed contract term that is typically 2-3 years. The GPUs typically pay for themselves during the initial lease term, leaving Applied Digital Cloud owning them free and clear at the end of the lease term for several more years of use. Applied takes very little risk here because at the time they purchase the GPUs there is already a contract in place for a full pay back of the equipment.

The NVDA investment is especially important for this segment because this is where NVDA can drive Applied’s future success. The hyperscalers are working on their own chips and are frienemies, so it is in NVDA’s long-term interest to ensure that there is a healthy ecosystem to support the consumption of their GPUs. They want companies like Applied and CoreWeave to prosper. NVDA can assure Applied’s success in a variety of ways by providing: (i) early allocations of the latest products; (ii) the best customer prospects who want to consume NVDA’s products as a service; and (iii) capital.

Consider what NVDA’s support did for CoreWeave. NVDA invested $100MM in CoreWeave in 2023 at a $2BN valuation. As of September 2024 CoreWeave was raising money at a $23BN valuation…. And look at where they are now. 

Valuing this segment is tricky because it is just getting started. If we assume it’s worth just 10% of CoreWeave, that’s $7BN. And it goes up from there. In the fullness of time, if Applied Digital Cloud prospers, then the company will spin this out as a separate company.   

**The High Level Setup**
Based on the recently announced data center lease with CoreWeave, it is clear that APLD is the real deal and has a chance to be a leader in the next gen data center buildout. BUT despite the recent surge in stock price, it has yet to go from zero to hero with the stock price still being vastly under valued.
 
Applied Digital will be the only pure play next-gen data center player in the public markets. There is no short thesis when NVDA and Related are anchor investors and a hyperscaler is a long-term partner and customer. APLD will fundamentally be worth a lot more than current prices, the stock should disconnect from any fundamental grounding as a result of being a public pureplay on the next AI bottleneck. The right tail asymmetry of this investment is under appreciated.  

**TLDR:** Company that used to mine magic internet money accidentally built a gold mine for AI. Now NVDA’s homies are renting it out, and the GPU gods might bless them with infinite tendies. Bags secured, brain not required

UP,1l7ij81,Top Golf and Callaway spinoff,"$MODG — Upcoming Spinoff Could Be the Launchpad. Don’t Sleep on This One.

Alright degenerates, hear me out.

$MODG (Topgolf Callaway Brands) is about to do something that very few are paying attention to — they’re spinning off their equipment division into a separate public company. This isn’t just corporate fluff — this is potentially rocket fuel.

Here’s why you should care:

Topgolf is the crown jewel – MODG owns Topgolf, which is basically the Dave & Buster’s of golf. Growing like crazy, expanding globally, and pulling in a younger demo. High margin, high growth, and borderline addictive for millennials and Zoomers.

The spinoff = multiple expansion – Wall Street loves a “pure play.” By splitting the slower, legacy equipment biz (Callaway clubs, balls, etc.) into its own entity, you free Topgolf from the drag. Investors can finally value Topgolf like a modern experiential brand, not a golf bag company.

Hidden value about to unlock – Analysts have consistently undervalued the company due to its blended structure. Post-spinoff, don’t be surprised if institutions jump in with fresh eyes and new models. It’s not a stretch to see this re-rated hard.

Add in the fact that the spinoff is expected to finalize in Q3 2025, and we’re looking at a classic “buy before the break” setup.

What am I missing here? Anyone else loading up pre-split or playing it through options?

UP,1l736uz,Why Sweetgreen Is Undervalued,"So here’s my honest take on why I think Sweetgreen is undervalued compared to where it’s heading in the future. For some context, I’ve been slowly accumulating shares since February 21st, 2023, with my first buy being 106 shares at $9.38. I currently hold 3,194.055 shares at an average cost of $23.66—which is about $9.61 higher than where the stock is trading today.

Anyway, here’s what I think is going right for Sweetgreen right now, and what’s not going so great:


What’s Going Well

1. Rewards Program Rolling Out Nicely
They just launched a new rewards program that gives 10 points for every $1 spent—and they’re signing up 20,000 new members a week. This is huge because it’ll let them target offers by customer segment and even individually, which is something that’s worked really well for other fast-casual chains to drive better same-store sales and revenue growth.

2. Infinite Kitchen Expansion = Big Efficiency Gains
They’re on track to open 40 new stores this year, and at least 20 of those will be the new Infinite Kitchen format. Plus, they’ll be opening their first Infinite Kitchen with a drive-thru, which could be a big deal down the road—drive-thrus are super competitive but also super profitable if you do them right.

The Infinite Kitchen is already showing big improvements—like around 700 basis points in margin boost mostly from labor savings, plus a potential 100 basis point COGS improvement. That’s at least 7 percentage points from labor and 1 point from COGS compared to similar stores without the tech.

The first Infinite Kitchen store hit a 26% restaurant-level margin in its first full month—that’s way better than the 20.4% average across the chain at the time. Less staff, more accuracy, faster service. Huge win.

3. Right Target Customer
Millennials and Gen Z are their core customer base—which is perfect because these groups really care about health, sustainability, transparency… everything Sweetgreen leans into. Together they make up like 43% of the U.S. population. Long-term this is the group you want.

4. Revenue Still Growing Despite Everything
Even with all the macro headwinds, fires in California (where a lot of their stores are), reduced marketing, and seasonal menu pullbacks, they’re still growing revenue at over 15% year-over-year. That’s not bad considering everything going on.


Valuation is Dirt Cheap Compared to Peers…

Here’s the kicker no one seems to be talking about—Sweetgreen is dirt cheap compared to the comps.

Right now they trade at a 2.1x EV/FY 2025 revenue multiple. That’s less than half of Chipotle’s valuation, and below Cava and even McDonald’s—who’s also struggling to grow same-store sales right now.

Their guidance says they’ll end FY 2025 with 286 stores (adding 40 this year), which puts their valuation at around $5.5 million EV per store. Chipotle is sitting at $16.2 million EV per store (with over 4,000 stores expected by year-end).

So yeah—Sweetgreen stores are underperforming right now. But the top-line pressure is mostly macro-related (stuff that should pass) and the margin squeeze should ease as they roll out more Infinite Kitchens.

For long-term investors willing to wait this out, this is a super cheap stock on both a revenue and per-store basis.


What’s Not Going So Well

1. Same-Store Sales Took a Hit
Q1 2025 was rough—same-store sales dropped 3.1%, which was the first negative comp since their IPO in 2021. People are spending less on discretionary stuff, and the fast-casual space is super competitive right now.

But I honestly think this is a temporary issue—they’re in a weird transition period with the loyalty program, there were the California wildfires, and they pulled back seasonal menu items. My guess is by the back half of the year, comps will be back on track.

2. Portion Size Complaints = Real Problem
This one is more anecdotal but I’ve spent some time (probably way too much time) digging through social media and reviews—and there’s a common theme: people think portions are small for the price they’re paying. Price per calorie is way worse than competitors and that’s something they really need to fix if they want loyal, repeat customers.

The Infinite Kitchen should help with this since everything is measured perfectly—but honestly I’m surprised these places don’t have like portioning spoons or scales for proteins to make sure staff isn’t shorting people. Seems like such an easy win.

3. Can They Get Loyalty Members to Come Back More Often?
20,000 new signups a week is great—but if those people don’t come back more often, it won’t matter. They need to find a way to get those new members hooked and visiting more frequently. If they do, same-store sales could pop big time.


Why I’m Still Super Bullish

Look, despite all this, I think Sweetgreen has a shot to 10x in the next 5–10 years, which would get them to an $18–20 billion market cap. That’s not crazy when you look at Chipotle sitting at $70B and Cava at $10B.

Plus, they’ve got tons of optionality left—new menu stuff, handheld items, healthy fountain drinks like kombucha (super high margin). This is a company going through a rough patch, but I think they’ll come out the other side way stronger.

UP,1l6rv8n,Verizon looks primed for a big rally.,"I'll keep this short and sweet, but here are the bullet points :

* Technically-speaking, VZ has been consolidating in a Bullish Pennant for weeks, it has reached the end of the pennant and looks poised to breakout. Call option volume has been picking up over this time, and puts have steadily been closing.
* When QQQ falls, people tend to seek safety in stable, high-dividend stocks like VZ (which generates a high 6%+ dividend). 
* Generally-speaking, VZ tends to be quite resilient when the market corrects. Especially when tech falls. If you put the 2 charts together, every time QQQ falls, VZ pumps. QQQ is forming a bearish divergence on the daily chart, and is looking ready to retrace a bit (there is also a gap fill that could occur down a little ways on QQQ, which could further fuel the pump in VZ).
* Most of the volume recently seems to be hedge funds hoarding shares. I've been browsing through the trade history and options flow. The $45 call has 40K+ OI, I've watched OI on that strike alone double over the past week, the stock could get gamma-squeezed. Weekly volume is increasing. Sentiment is 85% bullish. \*weekly chart pictured\*
* If tech stocks take a breather, which IMO it looks like they will this week, I think seeing 1 high volume green candle on VZ daily chart will confirm the breakout.
* Analyst estimates range from $47-55 for the year, I think it could start climbing into that range soon. When VZ rallies, it tends to rally 10-20% over a couple of weeks. Depending on where you measure the pennant pole, the target would be from \~$50-$55.

I think if there is anything that causes people to seek shelter outside of the bond market, which has been struggling lately, VZ is a prime candidate, and from a technical analysis perspective, it looks primed to rally hard.

Do what you will with this information. Godspeed regards!

UP,1l6dfob,"Powell praying AI paying, boomers buying  and you wanna short this","Honestly I still don’t get why people are so aggressively bearish. Like yeah, consumer data looks weak, retail earnings are trash, housing is soft  cool we get it. That’s been true for months  But have you actually looked at what moves the market right now?  


Big tech is absolutely ripping  AI isn’t some future fantasy  it’s real spend, real revenue, real margins. Nvda adds $300B in a week, Msft printing, Goog melting up  even Apple finally waking up. That’s literally half the index. And people think the S&P’s just gonna collapse? Lmao  


Every week I see the same doom porn  credit cracks, recession lurking, “this time it’s different”  and yet price action doesn’t care. You know why? Because when stuff does start breaking, the Fed eases. They don’t want a crash heading into an election year. They’ll pivot the second things get messy  
And the fear over rising delinquencies… yeah no kidding. What did you think would happen after the fastest hiking cycle in 40 years? Obviously credit gets tight. But this isn’t 2008. Unemployment is still under 4%, corporate balance sheets are solid, and the system isn’t imploding Chill  


The market’s not pricing in perfection. It’s pricing in “slightly less bad” and “maybe we get cuts”. Yields are easing, buybacks are rolling, and there’s no alternative that yields 30% YTD like $Qqq. Money has to go somewhere  


Truth is, most of you are still traumatized from 2022. You don’t trust green candles. You assume every rip is a bull trap. But markets don’t crash when everyone’s scared. They crash when everyone’s dancing on tables. Right now? Everyone’s still hiding in T-bills and buying puts  
You really think the S&P dumps while Apple is buying back stock like it’s a religion and boomers are auto-buying every paycheck? Come on  


And don’t even get me started on the Fed Powell’s out here praying the soft landing meme becomes real. They’re not raising again. They’re literally looking for a reason to cut. Give them one more bad payroll print and they’ll have the press release ready  
But sure, let me go sell all my longs and load puts because Starbucks missed same-store sales by 1.2%. Brilliant.  
This market isn’t euphoric  it’s hated. And that’s exactly why it keeps grinding higher

ALL,1l7wetd,Should you buy the dip? I analyzed all S&P 500 companies to find what happens if we only invest in companies undergoing drawdowns.,"To test, I picked all the companies in the S&P 500 list as of 2015. The backtest is simple— If a company drops by 50%, we invest $100 in that company and then hold.

I immediately ran into an issue. Out of the 502 companies on the list, 262 companies experienced a drawdown of more than 50% over the last 10 years. If you end up investing in all of them, your average return will be comparable to the index since you are holding half the index. *(Average return of 114% for the drawdown portfolio vs. 123% for the S&P 500).*

**Where it gets interesting is when we increase the drawdown cutoffs.**

# Drawdown cutoff — 75%

* Total amount of investment: $9,500
* Drawdown portfolio final value (June’25): $23,903 **(151% return)**

# Best and worst performers

As you would expect, investing in companies that had significant drawdowns would be highly volatile. After all, a stock that went down 90% can again go down another 90%!

Buy and hold seems to be the best strategy, as there would be many multi-baggers..

ALL,1l7ccch,Fintech seems like it could have legs for a while and SEZL will be my dark horse for this year and beyond.,"I will keep this short  as no one wants another AI generated dumpster fire . Yes i have a position see photos , all shares no calls which is a bummer. 

Little background: 
Company founded 2016 and was initially traded on the Austrian market . Moved to Nasdaq in 2023 and had a great run. Around Dec 2024 short seller Hindenburg research put out a hit piece and the stock dumped hard from Nov 24 to April 25. I posted on other sub Reddit about this stock when I sold some of my pltr gains and put it into this. it got very little traction 🤷‍♂️ but whatever people don’t want to make money thats on them . Good news I think she still has some left in the tank and am letting the house money ride after pulling out a bit of the gains at the start of this month and regretting it ever since. 

Why it’s worth a look now:
1) BNPL booming with younger generations and anyone with no money (aka most of us)

2)improving financials  with positive cash flow in the last earnings call looking good .

3) if consolidation occurs in this space Sezzle looks like a prime choice for a big player. 

4)MOST IMPORTANT POINT Sezzle used to be a Twolves floor sponsor and are currently the jersey sponsor. Thats a big D move . 

5) strong insider ownership ~53% last time I checked yahoo finance. 

6) jimmy chill said sell on Sezzle a few weeks ago on his lighting round seems like a good inverse Kramer play. I foolishly took some off and regretted but I was trying to not let the position be more than 20-25% of my over all holdings. 

TLDR : I think there are multiple player in fintech that have good times ahead .

Their guidance says they’ll end FY 2025 with 286 stores (adding 40 this year), which puts their valuation at around $5.5 million EV per store. Chipotle is sitting at $16.2 million EV per store (with over 4,000 stores expected by year-end).

So yeah—Sweetgreen stores are underperforming right now. But the top-line pressure is mostly macro-related (stuff that should pass) and the margin squeeze should ease as they roll out more Infinite Kitchens.

For long-term investors willing to wait this out, this is a super cheap stock on both a revenue and per-store basis.


What’s Not Going So Well

1. Same-Store Sales Took a Hit
Q1 2025 was rough—same-store sales dropped 3.1%, which was the first negative comp since their IPO in 2021. People are spending less on discretionary stuff, and the fast-casual space is super competitive right now.

But I honestly think this is a temporary issue—they’re in a weird transition period with the loyalty program, there were the California wildfires, and they pulled back seasonal menu items. My guess is by the back half of the year, comps will be back on track.

2. Portion Size Complaints = Real Problem
This one is more anecdotal but I’ve spent some time (probably way too much time) digging through social media and reviews—and there’s a common theme: people think portions are small for the price they’re paying. Price per calorie is way worse than competitors and that’s something they really need to fix if they want loyal, repeat customers.

The Infinite Kitchen should help with this since everything is measured perfectly—but honestly I’m surprised these places don’t have like portioning spoons or scales for proteins to make sure staff isn’t shorting people. Seems like such an easy win.

3. Can They Get Loyalty Members to Come Back More Often?
20,000 new signups a week is great—but if those people don’t come back more often, it won’t matter. They need to find a way to get those new members hooked and visiting more frequently. If they do, same-store sales could pop big time.


Why I’m Still Super Bullish

Look, despite all this, I think Sweetgreen has a shot to 10x in the next 5–10 years, which would get them to an $18–20 billion market cap. That’s not crazy when you look at Chipotle sitting at $70B and Cava at $10B.

Plus, they’ve got tons of optionality left—new menu stuff, handheld items, healthy fountain drinks like kombucha (super high margin). This is a company going through a rough patch, but I think they’ll come out the other side way stronger.

Truth is, most of you are still traumatized from 2022. You don’t trust green candles. You assume every rip is a bull trap. But markets don’t crash when everyone’s scared. They crash when everyone’s dancing on tables. Right now? Everyone’s still hiding in T-bills and buying puts

Little background: 
Company founded 2016 and was initially traded on the Austrian market . Moved to Nasdaq in 2023 and had a great run. Around Dec 2024 short seller Hindenburg research put out a hit piece and the stock dumped hard from Nov 24 to April 25. I posted on other sub Reddit about this stock when I sold some of my pltr gains and put it into this. it got very little traction 🤷‍♂️ but whatever people don’t want to make money thats on them . Good news I think she still has some left in the tank and am letting the house money ride after pulling out a bit of the gains at the start of this month and regretting it ever since. 

Why it’s worth a look now:
1) BNPL booming with younger generations and anyone with no money (aka most of us)

2)improving financials  with positive cash flow in the last earnings call looking good .

3) if consolidation occurs in this space Sezzle looks like a prime choice for a big player. 

4)MOST IMPORTANT POINT Sezzle used to be a Twolves floor sponsor and are currently the jersey sponsor. Thats a big D move . 

5) strong insider ownership ~53% last time I checked yahoo finance. 

6) jimmy chill said sell on Sezzle a few weeks ago on his lighting round seems like a good inverse Kramer play. I foolishly took some off and regretted but I was trying to not let the position be more than 20-25% of my over all holdings.

NOW,1l736uz,Why Sweetgreen Is Undervalued,"So here’s my honest take on why I think Sweetgreen is undervalued compared to where it’s heading in the future. For some context, I’ve been slowly accumulating shares since February 21st, 2023, with my first buy being 106 shares at $9.38. I currently hold 3,194.055 shares at an average cost of $23.66—which is about $9.61 higher than where the stock is trading today.

Anyway, here’s what I think is going right for Sweetgreen right now, and what’s not going so great:


What’s Going Well

1. Rewards Program Rolling Out Nicely
They just launched a new rewards program that gives 10 points for every $1 spent—and they’re signing up 20,000 new members a week. This is huge because it’ll let them target offers by customer segment and even individually, which is something that’s worked really well for other fast-casual chains to drive better same-store sales and revenue growth.

2. Infinite Kitchen Expansion = Big Efficiency Gains
They’re on track to open 40 new stores this year, and at least 20 of those will be the new Infinite Kitchen format. Plus, they’ll be opening their first Infinite Kitchen with a drive-thru, which could be a big deal down the road—drive-thrus are super competitive but also super profitable if you do them right.

The Infinite Kitchen is already showing big improvements—like around 700 basis points in margin boost mostly from labor savings, plus a potential 100 basis point COGS improvement. That’s at least 7 percentage points from labor and 1 point from COGS compared to similar stores without the tech.

The first Infinite Kitchen store hit a 26% restaurant-level margin in its first full month—that’s way better than the 20.4% average across the chain at the time. Less staff, more accuracy, faster service. Huge win.

3. Right Target Customer
Millennials and Gen Z are their core customer base—which is perfect because these groups really care about health, sustainability, transparency… everything Sweetgreen leans into. Together they make up like 43% of the U.S. population. Long-term this is the group you want.

4. Revenue Still Growing Despite Everything
Even with all the macro headwinds, fires in California (where a lot of their stores are), reduced marketing, and seasonal menu pullbacks, they’re still growing revenue at over 15% year-over-year. That’s not bad considering everything going on.


Valuation is Dirt Cheap Compared to Peers…

Here’s the kicker no one seems to be talking about—Sweetgreen is dirt cheap compared to the comps.

Right now they trade at a 2.1x EV/FY 2025 revenue multiple. That’s less than half of Chipotle’s valuation, and below Cava and even McDonald’s—who’s also struggling to grow same-store sales right now.

Their guidance says they’ll end FY 2025 with 286 stores (adding 40 this year), which puts their valuation at around $5.5 million EV per store. Chipotle is sitting at $16.2 million EV per store (with over 4,000 stores expected by year-end).

So yeah—Sweetgreen stores are underperforming right now. But the top-line pressure is mostly macro-related (stuff that should pass) and the margin squeeze should ease as they roll out more Infinite Kitchens.

For long-term investors willing to wait this out, this is a super cheap stock on both a revenue and per-store basis.


What’s Not Going So Well

1. Same-Store Sales Took a Hit
Q1 2025 was rough—same-store sales dropped 3.1%, which was the first negative comp since their IPO in 2021. People are spending less on discretionary stuff, and the fast-casual space is super competitive right now.

But I honestly think this is a temporary issue—they’re in a weird transition period with the loyalty program, there were the California wildfires, and they pulled back seasonal menu items. My guess is by the back half of the year, comps will be back on track.

2. Portion Size Complaints = Real Problem
This one is more anecdotal but I’ve spent some time (probably way too much time) digging through social media and reviews—and there’s a common theme: people think portions are small for the price they’re paying. Price per calorie is way worse than competitors and that’s something they really need to fix if they want loyal, repeat customers.

The Infinite Kitchen should help with this since everything is measured perfectly—but honestly I’m surprised these places don’t have like portioning spoons or scales for proteins to make sure staff isn’t shorting people. Seems like such an easy win.

3. Can They Get Loyalty Members to Come Back More Often?
20,000 new signups a week is great—but if those people don’t come back more often, it won’t matter. They need to find a way to get those new members hooked and visiting more frequently. If they do, same-store sales could pop big time.


Why I’m Still Super Bullish

Look, despite all this, I think Sweetgreen has a shot to 10x in the next 5–10 years, which would get them to an $18–20 billion market cap. That’s not crazy when you look at Chipotle sitting at $70B and Cava at $10B.

Plus, they’ve got tons of optionality left—new menu stuff, handheld items, healthy fountain drinks like kombucha (super high margin). This is a company going through a rough patch, but I think they’ll come out the other side way stronger.

NOW,1l628m7,why GOOGL (Alphabet) is a great buy right now,"With WWDC and the Robotaxi event next week, I'd like to discuss Google and its parent company Alphabet, they have been in trouble for a while now regarding some bullshit anti-trust cases, and I want to tell you why its pure FUD.  Google has really caught up with the rest of the Mag 7 giants in their AI advancements if you haven't noticed.  They have been doing AI machine learning since 2001.  Bard was unimpressive, but that was only little over a year ago.  The speed at which they have been making new advancements is almost hard to track (even across other LLM's).

Have you tried Gemini?  VEO 3 costs 250/m and people are loving it. (the rev. from that will be great as well) and the new AI mode for search seems to finally have been embraced and I think they can actually leverage AI to better serve people the right business ads / referrals.  ***Either way they are monetizing AI***\*...\*

Regarding all the FUD, I dont believe the judge can make them sell chrome, EU case is just stupid, the whole thing is about them having monopoly on search and ads...  well there is Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo, Perplexity, Meta / Instagram business Ads, etc..  they have no monopoly anymore if there was one...

I dont believe the cases will result in anything materially bad for the stock but nobody can be sure, so that is why I want to dig into the Fundmental and Technical Analysis.

# ----------- Fundamentals -----------

Alphabet is a massive conglomerate with many subsidiaries.  Lets talk about how they are competing and kicking ass in so many different industries.

\-

**AI:**  

*VEO 3, AI Mode, Gemini, DeepMind* \- Competing with GPT pro, Microsoft, etc.  (note VEO 3 is still the only model that does text to video PLUS audio.  I think they leveraged youtube for it.

**Data Centers / Internet Provider:**

\-----*Google Cloud, TPU's, Google Fiber* \-Competing with many, but their TPU's are very good for AI data centers, and google Fiber competes with internet / service providers like AT&T / Comcast / T-Mobile, etc..

**Quantum Computing:**

\------Competing with Microsoft, IBM, Rigetti, etc.

**Smart Phones:**

\------*Android, Pixel Phone* (with Gemini that kicks Siri's ass) - competing with Apple big-time

**Streaming / Ads:**

\------*Youtube & Google Ads* \- Competing with Meta and Netflix

**Smart Home / Wearables:**

\------*Nest, Fitbit,* & ***XR Glasses*** \- Competing with Amazon, Apple's announced glasses and their 'watch', Microsoft, etc.

**Autonomous Driving / UAV Delivery:**

\------***Waymo, Wing*** \- Competing with Tesla (been kicking their ass on it for a while now), GM, and yes, Amazon Air delivery.  *They also just announced another partnership with Walmart to bring more drones to over 100 stores for deliveries!*

**AI in Healthcare / Biotech:**

\------*Verily, & Calico* \- working on aging / genetics and ai in healthcare.

\-*and probably a few others i've missed..*.  but the scope of their work is clear.

\-

When you buy GOOGL you are buying the entirety of Alphabets investments.  And they are so well positioned from a fundamental and financial perspective as seen in this group of charts.  They make double nearly double the revenue of Nvidia...

[Google makes more revenue than the rest of the Mag 7, nearly double Nvidia's earnings!  the only exception of Apple which could be in jeopardy too if they dont continue to innovate.](https://preview.redd.it/i61ok3bywl5f1.png?width=1183&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab383da02f61b9d5fdc7bb71ce2bde6c7d453ac2)

\-

Yet oddly, Google has the lowest P/E (price to earnings) ratio than the rest of the Mag 7!  That seems off if you ask me.  I believe they can take plenty of market share back in the future based on these 2 figures.

https://preview.redd.it/a61jyxhzwl5f1.png?width=1125&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b85188b91cd7b2b6b95516e18513586d86d630b

\-

# -------- Technical Analysis --------

so now lets look at the Chart!  Because Price Action Speaks more than anything else...

I like to use Multiple Timeframes for analysis so here I have the 4 hour, daily, and weekly charts.

I know there are a lot of lines and colors, dont be scared.  The indicators I use are patterns combined with price action, fib levels, TTM squeeze, RSI and some other factors such as price gaps.

\- With RSI, above/below the 50 line tells you if momentum is bullish or bearish.  All the higher timeframes are above that 50 line indicating a potential bullish reversal.

\- With TTM it makes it easier to visualize these momentum shifts.  Right now my focus is on that Weekly chart on the bottom right - higher time frames are usually more important and it appears to be on the verge of a weekly breakout.  Now with a stock like this it could take months to reach that earnings Gap and make a new all time high.  When or If this happens depends on a lot of factors, but I am only focusing on the chart.

\- The Fibonacci Retracements I mostly use for the 50% line to determine if the price has had a change of trend.  Right now the price is attempting a breakout above this retracement and if it can break over 175 then there is plenty of room up.

\- Ive also illustrated some patterns and concepts on the chart.  Inverted Head and Shoulders, Trendline Break, Higher Highs and Higher Lows, potentially an even larger inverted H&S on the daily chart to the top right.

https://preview.redd.it/d2fprue33m5f1.jpg?width=3676&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=77f0a1e390e7b81ec6f893f6f38220ffc3fde21f

Ok so what does this technical analysis mumbo jumbo mean?  Its hard to say because of Trump, Tarrifs, Deals, Interest Rates, Bonds, Geopolitics, the fact that the market has already just about reached all time highs and this is lagging...  it is concerning.  It could also just be setting up for a massive (bearish) head and shoulders as you might notice on the bottom right weekly chart.

But with WWDC, RoboTaxi, and several trump deals supposedly taking place next week, we could be setup for some bullish continuation if these tech events impress.  Either way, Long Term I believe Google / Alphabet stock will get back to 200.

From a technical and fundamental perspective they are in great shape.  I would even bet that if the market pulls back, that institutions may rotate their Mag 7 holdings into the laggards such as this and Amazon.

While they are aggressively competing with so many different companies and industries, their earnings are expected to continue to grow and as you saw earlier, they earn double what Nvidia earns... Pelosi still has calls, and lets face it, you still use some kind of google product in your life whether its youtube, your android based phone, ai / gemini research, waymo, etc...  I believe Google is well positioned to be a winner this year in AI and many of its subsidiary company products.

\--------------

# TLDR:

**Alphabet is a great Bet !**

I currently am selling put credit spreads on GOOGL, and have several 180 calls for 7/18 that I only plan to hold through next week before I re-enter as there is going to be a lot going on next week for the markets.

NEXT,1l736uz,Why Sweetgreen Is Undervalued,"So here’s my honest take on why I think Sweetgreen is undervalued compared to where it’s heading in the future. For some context, I’ve been slowly accumulating shares since February 21st, 2023, with my first buy being 106 shares at $9.38. I currently hold 3,194.055 shares at an average cost of $23.66—which is about $9.61 higher than where the stock is trading today.

Anyway, here’s what I think is going right for Sweetgreen right now, and what’s not going so great:


What’s Going Well

1. Rewards Program Rolling Out Nicely
They just launched a new rewards program that gives 10 points for every $1 spent—and they’re signing up 20,000 new members a week. This is huge because it’ll let them target offers by customer segment and even individually, which is something that’s worked really well for other fast-casual chains to drive better same-store sales and revenue growth.

2. Infinite Kitchen Expansion = Big Efficiency Gains
They’re on track to open 40 new stores this year, and at least 20 of those will be the new Infinite Kitchen format. Plus, they’ll be opening their first Infinite Kitchen with a drive-thru, which could be a big deal down the road—drive-thrus are super competitive but also super profitable if you do them right.

The Infinite Kitchen is already showing big improvements—like around 700 basis points in margin boost mostly from labor savings, plus a potential 100 basis point COGS improvement. That’s at least 7 percentage points from labor and 1 point from COGS compared to similar stores without the tech.

The first Infinite Kitchen store hit a 26% restaurant-level margin in its first full month—that’s way better than the 20.4% average across the chain at the time. Less staff, more accuracy, faster service. Huge win.

3. Right Target Customer
Millennials and Gen Z are their core customer base—which is perfect because these groups really care about health, sustainability, transparency… everything Sweetgreen leans into. Together they make up like 43% of the U.S. population. Long-term this is the group you want.

4. Revenue Still Growing Despite Everything
Even with all the macro headwinds, fires in California (where a lot of their stores are), reduced marketing, and seasonal menu pullbacks, they’re still growing revenue at over 15% year-over-year. That’s not bad considering everything going on.


Valuation is Dirt Cheap Compared to Peers…

Here’s the kicker no one seems to be talking about—Sweetgreen is dirt cheap compared to the comps.

Right now they trade at a 2.1x EV/FY 2025 revenue multiple. That’s less than half of Chipotle’s valuation, and below Cava and even McDonald’s—who’s also struggling to grow same-store sales right now.

Their guidance says they’ll end FY 2025 with 286 stores (adding 40 this year), which puts their valuation at around $5.5 million EV per store. Chipotle is sitting at $16.2 million EV per store (with over 4,000 stores expected by year-end).

So yeah—Sweetgreen stores are underperforming right now. But the top-line pressure is mostly macro-related (stuff that should pass) and the margin squeeze should ease as they roll out more Infinite Kitchens.

For long-term investors willing to wait this out, this is a super cheap stock on both a revenue and per-store basis.


What’s Not Going So Well

1. Same-Store Sales Took a Hit
Q1 2025 was rough—same-store sales dropped 3.1%, which was the first negative comp since their IPO in 2021. People are spending less on discretionary stuff, and the fast-casual space is super competitive right now.

But I honestly think this is a temporary issue—they’re in a weird transition period with the loyalty program, there were the California wildfires, and they pulled back seasonal menu items. My guess is by the back half of the year, comps will be back on track.

2. Portion Size Complaints = Real Problem
This one is more anecdotal but I’ve spent some time (probably way too much time) digging through social media and reviews—and there’s a common theme: people think portions are small for the price they’re paying. Price per calorie is way worse than competitors and that’s something they really need to fix if they want loyal, repeat customers.

The Infinite Kitchen should help with this since everything is measured perfectly—but honestly I’m surprised these places don’t have like portioning spoons or scales for proteins to make sure staff isn’t shorting people. Seems like such an easy win.

3. Can They Get Loyalty Members to Come Back More Often?
20,000 new signups a week is great—but if those people don’t come back more often, it won’t matter. They need to find a way to get those new members hooked and visiting more frequently. If they do, same-store sales could pop big time.


Why I’m Still Super Bullish

Look, despite all this, I think Sweetgreen has a shot to 10x in the next 5–10 years, which would get them to an $18–20 billion market cap. That’s not crazy when you look at Chipotle sitting at $70B and Cava at $10B.

Plus, they’ve got tons of optionality left—new menu stuff, handheld items, healthy fountain drinks like kombucha (super high margin). This is a company going through a rough patch, but I think they’ll come out the other side way stronger.

NEXT,1l628m7,why GOOGL (Alphabet) is a great buy right now,"With WWDC and the Robotaxi event next week, I'd like to discuss Google and its parent company Alphabet, they have been in trouble for a while now regarding some bullshit anti-trust cases, and I want to tell you why its pure FUD.  Google has really caught up with the rest of the Mag 7 giants in their AI advancements if you haven't noticed.  They have been doing AI machine learning since 2001.  Bard was unimpressive, but that was only little over a year ago.  The speed at which they have been making new advancements is almost hard to track (even across other LLM's).

Have you tried Gemini?  VEO 3 costs 250/m and people are loving it. (the rev. from that will be great as well) and the new AI mode for search seems to finally have been embraced and I think they can actually leverage AI to better serve people the right business ads / referrals.  ***Either way they are monetizing AI***\*...\*

Regarding all the FUD, I dont believe the judge can make them sell chrome, EU case is just stupid, the whole thing is about them having monopoly on search and ads...  well there is Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo, Perplexity, Meta / Instagram business Ads, etc..  they have no monopoly anymore if there was one...

I dont believe the cases will result in anything materially bad for the stock but nobody can be sure, so that is why I want to dig into the Fundmental and Technical Analysis.

# ----------- Fundamentals -----------

Alphabet is a massive conglomerate with many subsidiaries.  Lets talk about how they are competing and kicking ass in so many different industries.

\-

**AI:**  

*VEO 3, AI Mode, Gemini, DeepMind* \- Competing with GPT pro, Microsoft, etc.  (note VEO 3 is still the only model that does text to video PLUS audio.  I think they leveraged youtube for it.

**Data Centers / Internet Provider:**

\-----*Google Cloud, TPU's, Google Fiber* \-Competing with many, but their TPU's are very good for AI data centers, and google Fiber competes with internet / service providers like AT&T / Comcast / T-Mobile, etc..

**Quantum Computing:**

\------Competing with Microsoft, IBM, Rigetti, etc.

**Smart Phones:**

\------*Android, Pixel Phone* (with Gemini that kicks Siri's ass) - competing with Apple big-time

**Streaming / Ads:**

\------*Youtube & Google Ads* \- Competing with Meta and Netflix

**Smart Home / Wearables:**

\------*Nest, Fitbit,* & ***XR Glasses*** \- Competing with Amazon, Apple's announced glasses and their 'watch', Microsoft, etc.

**Autonomous Driving / UAV Delivery:**

\------***Waymo, Wing*** \- Competing with Tesla (been kicking their ass on it for a while now), GM, and yes, Amazon Air delivery.  *They also just announced another partnership with Walmart to bring more drones to over 100 stores for deliveries!*

**AI in Healthcare / Biotech:**

\------*Verily, & Calico* \- working on aging / genetics and ai in healthcare.

\-*and probably a few others i've missed..*.  but the scope of their work is clear.

\-

When you buy GOOGL you are buying the entirety of Alphabets investments.  And they are so well positioned from a fundamental and financial perspective as seen in this group of charts.  They make double nearly double the revenue of Nvidia...

[Google makes more revenue than the rest of the Mag 7, nearly double Nvidia's earnings!  the only exception of Apple which could be in jeopardy too if they dont continue to innovate.](https://preview.redd.it/i61ok3bywl5f1.png?width=1183&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab383da02f61b9d5fdc7bb71ce2bde6c7d453ac2)

\-

Yet oddly, Google has the lowest P/E (price to earnings) ratio than the rest of the Mag 7!  That seems off if you ask me.  I believe they can take plenty of market share back in the future based on these 2 figures.

https://preview.redd.it/a61jyxhzwl5f1.png?width=1125&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b85188b91cd7b2b6b95516e18513586d86d630b

\-

# -------- Technical Analysis --------

so now lets look at the Chart!  Because Price Action Speaks more than anything else...

I like to use Multiple Timeframes for analysis so here I have the 4 hour, daily, and weekly charts.

I know there are a lot of lines and colors, dont be scared.  The indicators I use are patterns combined with price action, fib levels, TTM squeeze, RSI and some other factors such as price gaps.

\- With RSI, above/below the 50 line tells you if momentum is bullish or bearish.  All the higher timeframes are above that 50 line indicating a potential bullish reversal.

\- With TTM it makes it easier to visualize these momentum shifts.  Right now my focus is on that Weekly chart on the bottom right - higher time frames are usually more important and it appears to be on the verge of a weekly breakout.  Now with a stock like this it could take months to reach that earnings Gap and make a new all time high.  When or If this happens depends on a lot of factors, but I am only focusing on the chart.

\- The Fibonacci Retracements I mostly use for the 50% line to determine if the price has had a change of trend.  Right now the price is attempting a breakout above this retracement and if it can break over 175 then there is plenty of room up.

\- Ive also illustrated some patterns and concepts on the chart.  Inverted Head and Shoulders, Trendline Break, Higher Highs and Higher Lows, potentially an even larger inverted H&S on the daily chart to the top right.

https://preview.redd.it/d2fprue33m5f1.jpg?width=3676&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=77f0a1e390e7b81ec6f893f6f38220ffc3fde21f

Ok so what does this technical analysis mumbo jumbo mean?  Its hard to say because of Trump, Tarrifs, Deals, Interest Rates, Bonds, Geopolitics, the fact that the market has already just about reached all time highs and this is lagging...  it is concerning.  It could also just be setting up for a massive (bearish) head and shoulders as you might notice on the bottom right weekly chart.

But with WWDC, RoboTaxi, and several trump deals supposedly taking place next week, we could be setup for some bullish continuation if these tech events impress.  Either way, Long Term I believe Google / Alphabet stock will get back to 200.

From a technical and fundamental perspective they are in great shape.  I would even bet that if the market pulls back, that institutions may rotate their Mag 7 holdings into the laggards such as this and Amazon.

While they are aggressively competing with so many different companies and industries, their earnings are expected to continue to grow and as you saw earlier, they earn double what Nvidia earns... Pelosi still has calls, and lets face it, you still use some kind of google product in your life whether its youtube, your android based phone, ai / gemini research, waymo, etc...  I believe Google is well positioned to be a winner this year in AI and many of its subsidiary company products.

\--------------

# TLDR:

**Alphabet is a great Bet !**

I currently am selling put credit spreads on GOOGL, and have several 180 calls for 7/18 that I only plan to hold through next week before I re-enter as there is going to be a lot going on next week for the markets.  Their earnings are on 7/22 I believe, so August may be a better strike date.  Shares or LEAPS (calls dated atleast for 2026) are also a good idea IMO, you can sell calls against them to hedge when there are large spikes.

**Anyway, I am highly regarded** ***and this is not financial advice,*** but I am very bullish on Google long term.  Its not an easy one to trade if you like short dated options, you need patience, but the chart, the p/e ratios, the incredible amount of subsidiaries competing with more than other Mag 7 companies makes this thing a highly undervalued growth & value stock.

*35x TSLA Jul18'25 300 Put*

Alright regards, here's why there's still plenty of juice left in this TSLA correction.

1) Robotaxi release is gonna be a total bust/sell-the-news. Nobody trusts FSD, nobody would hop in a Tesla when they could easily get a Waymo that has been tested for multiple years. Press is going to be watching like a hawk for any mishaps/bugs, which there will be. This is definitely not going to be what investors were hoping for.  
  
2) Robotaxi release is high-risk, expect to see investors close positions leading up to the event. Cue in any number of videos showing FSD mowing down pedestrians or showing how bad a camera-only system is. I wouldn't want to risk a large position going into this. This whole robotaxi venture was dead the moment Enron refused to put LiDAR on the cars.  
  
3) There was hype surrounding Enron's departure from the administration. Would've taken a goddamn miracle but honestly if he left the administration quietly, making sure not to burn any bridges, maybe he could save the brand a bit while still getting the benefits of being close to the admin. Except now he's getting in brawls with the administration and trashing their bill. He's burning all the bridges.

4) Declining sales and other stuff that doesn't actually affect the stock price at all.

5) CPI next week, likely to actually start showing the effects of tariffs.

CAN,1l7wetd,Should you buy the dip? I analyzed all S&P 500 companies to find what happens if we only invest in companies undergoing drawdowns.,"To test, I picked all the companies in the S&P 500 list as of 2015. The backtest is simple— If a company drops by 50%, we invest $100 in that company and then hold.

I immediately ran into an issue. Out of the 502 companies on the list, 262 companies experienced a drawdown of more than 50% over the last 10 years. If you end up investing in all of them, your average return will be comparable to the index since you are holding half the index. *(Average return of 114% for the drawdown portfolio vs. 123% for the S&P 500).*

**Where it gets interesting is when we increase the drawdown cutoffs.**

# Drawdown cutoff — 75%

* Total amount of investment: $9,500
* Drawdown portfolio final value (June’25): $23,903 **(151% return)**
* Comparable S&P 500 index: $20,467 **(115% return)**
* Alpha — 36%
* Median return: 68.4%

# Drawdown cutoff — 90%

As you would expect, investing in companies that had significant drawdowns would be highly volatile. After all, a stock that went down 90% can again go down another 90%!

Buy and hold seems to be the best strategy, as there would be many multi-baggers..

CAN,1l7ij81,Top Golf and Callaway spinoff,"$MODG — Upcoming Spinoff Could Be the Launchpad. Don’t Sleep on This One.

Alright degenerates, hear me out.

$MODG (Topgolf Callaway Brands) is about to do something that very few are paying attention to — they’re spinning off their equipment division into a separate public company. This isn’t just corporate fluff — this is potentially rocket fuel.

Here’s why you should care:

Topgolf is the crown jewel – MODG owns Topgolf, which is basically the Dave & Buster’s of golf. Growing like crazy, expanding globally, and pulling in a younger demo. High margin, high growth, and borderline addictive for millennials and Zoomers.

The spinoff = multiple expansion – Wall Street loves a “pure play.” By splitting the slower, legacy equipment biz (Callaway clubs, balls, etc.) into its own entity, you free Topgolf from the drag. Investors can finally value Topgolf like a modern experiential brand, not a golf bag company.

Hidden value about to unlock – Analysts have consistently undervalued the company due to its blended structure. Post-spinoff, don’t be surprised if institutions jump in with fresh eyes and new models. It’s not a stretch to see this re-rated hard.

Add in the fact that the spinoff is expected to finalize in Q3 2025, and we’re looking at a classic “buy before the break” setup.

What am I missing here? Anyone else loading up pre-split or playing it through options?

Let’s talk — bullish case, bear case, or your favorite play structure. But either way, this might be the last chance to get in before this thing tees off.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1l7ij81/top_golf_and_callaway_spinoff/,1749508116.0,0,71,wallstreetbets

CAN,1l736uz,Why Sweetgreen Is Undervalued,"So here’s my honest take on why I think Sweetgreen is undervalued compared to where it’s heading in the future. For some context, I’ve been slowly accumulating shares since February 21st, 2023, with my first buy being 106 shares at $9.38. I currently hold 3,194.055 shares at an average cost of $23.66—which is about $9.61 higher than where the stock is trading today.

Anyway, here’s what I think is going right for Sweetgreen right now, and what’s not going so great:


What’s Going Well

1. Rewards Program Rolling Out Nicely
They just launched a new rewards program that gives 10 points for every $1 spent—and they’re signing up 20,000 new members a week. This is huge because it’ll let them target offers by customer segment and even individually, which is something that’s worked really well for other fast-casual chains to drive better same-store sales and revenue growth.

2. Infinite Kitchen Expansion = Big Efficiency Gains
They’re on track to open 40 new stores this year, and at least 20 of those will be the new Infinite Kitchen format. Plus, they’ll be opening their first Infinite Kitchen with a drive-thru, which could be a big deal down the road—drive-thrus are super competitive but also super profitable if you do them right.

The Infinite Kitchen is already showing big improvements—like around 700 basis points in margin boost mostly from labor savings, plus a potential 100 basis point COGS improvement. That’s at least 7 percentage points from labor and 1 point from COGS compared to similar stores without the tech.

The first Infinite Kitchen store hit a 26% restaurant-level margin in its first full month—that’s way better than the 20.4% average across the chain at the time. Less staff, more accuracy, faster service. Huge win.

3. Right Target Customer
Millennials and Gen Z are their core customer base—which is perfect because these groups really care about health, sustainability, transparency… everything Sweetgreen leans into. Together they make up like 43% of the U.S. population. Long-term this is the group you want.

4. Revenue Still Growing Despite Everything
Even with all the macro headwinds, fires in California (where a lot of their stores are), reduced marketing, and seasonal menu pullbacks, they’re still growing revenue at over 15% year-over-year. That’s not bad considering everything going on.


Valuation is Dirt Cheap Compared to Peers…

Here’s the kicker no one seems to be talking about—Sweetgreen is dirt cheap compared to the comps.

Right now they trade at a 2.1x EV/FY 2025 revenue multiple. That’s less than half of Chipotle’s valuation, and below Cava and even McDonald’s—who’s also struggling to grow same-store sales right now.

Their guidance says they’ll end FY 2025 with 286 stores (adding 40 this year), which puts their valuation at around $5.5 million EV per store. Chipotle is sitting at $16.2 million EV per store (with over 4,000 stores expected by year-end).

So yeah—Sweetgreen stores are underperforming right now. But the top-line pressure is mostly macro-related (stuff that should pass) and the margin squeeze should ease as they roll out more Infinite Kitchens.

For long-term investors willing to wait this out, this is a super cheap stock on both a revenue and per-store basis.


What’s Not Going So Well

1. Same-Store Sales Took a Hit
Q1 2025 was rough—same-store sales dropped 3.1%, which was the first negative comp since their IPO in 2021. People are spending less on discretionary stuff, and the fast-casual space is super competitive right now.

But I honestly think this is a temporary issue—they’re in a weird transition period with the loyalty program, there were the California wildfires, and they pulled back seasonal menu items. My guess is by the back half of the year, comps will be back on track.

2. Portion Size Complaints = Real Problem
This one is more anecdotal but I’ve spent some time (probably way too much time) digging through social media and reviews—and there’s a common theme: people think portions are small for the price they’re paying. Price per calorie is way worse than competitors and that’s something they really need to fix if they want loyal, repeat customers.

The Infinite Kitchen should help with this since everything is measured perfectly—but honestly I’m surprised these places don’t have like portioning spoons or scales for proteins to make sure staff isn’t shorting people. Seems like such an easy win.

3. Can They Get Loyalty Members to Come Back More Often?
20,000 new signups a week is great—but if those people don’t come back more often, it won’t matter. They need to find a way to get those new members hooked and visiting more frequently. If they do, same-store sales could pop big time.


Why I’m Still Super Bullish

Look, despite all this, I think Sweetgreen has a shot to 10x in the next 5–10 years, which would get them to an $18–20 billion market cap. That’s not crazy when you look at Chipotle sitting at $70B and Cava at $10B.

Plus, they’ve got tons of optionality left—new menu stuff, handheld items, healthy fountain drinks like kombucha (super high margin). This is a company going through a rough patch, but I think they’ll come out the other side way stronger.

CAN,1l628m7,why GOOGL (Alphabet) is a great buy right now,"With WWDC and the Robotaxi event next week, I'd like to discuss Google and its parent company Alphabet, they have been in trouble for a while now regarding some bullshit anti-trust cases, and I want to tell you why its pure FUD.  Google has really caught up with the rest of the Mag 7 giants in their AI advancements if you haven't noticed.  They have been doing AI machine learning since 2001.  Bard was unimpressive, but that was only little over a year ago.  The speed at which they have been making new advancements is almost hard to track (even across other LLM's).

Have you tried Gemini?  VEO 3 costs 250/m and people are loving it. (the rev. from that will be great as well) and the new AI mode for search seems to finally have been embraced and I think they can actually leverage AI to better serve people the right business ads / referrals.  ***Either way they are monetizing AI***\*...\*

Regarding all the FUD, I dont believe the judge can make them sell chrome, EU case is just stupid, the whole thing is about them having monopoly on search and ads...  well there is Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo, Perplexity, Meta / Instagram business Ads, etc..  they have no monopoly anymore if there was one...

I dont believe the cases will result in anything materially bad for the stock but nobody can be sure, so that is why I want to dig into the Fundmental and Technical Analysis.

# ----------- Fundamentals -----------

Alphabet is a massive conglomerate with many subsidiaries.  Lets talk about how they are competing and kicking ass in so many different industries.

\-

**AI:**  

*VEO 3, AI Mode, Gemini, DeepMind* \- Competing with GPT pro, Microsoft, etc.  (note VEO 3 is still the only model that does text to video PLUS audio.  I think they leveraged youtube for it.

**Data Centers / Internet Provider:**

\-----*Google Cloud, TPU's, Google Fiber* \-Competing with many, but their TPU's are very good for AI data centers, and google Fiber competes with internet / service providers like AT&T / Comcast / T-Mobile, etc..

**Quantum Computing:**

\------Competing with Microsoft, IBM, Rigetti, etc.

**Smart Phones:**

\------*Android, Pixel Phone* (with Gemini that kicks Siri's ass) - competing with Apple big-time

**Streaming / Ads:**

\------*Youtube & Google Ads* \- Competing with Meta and Netflix

**Smart Home / Wearables:**

\------*Nest, Fitbit,* & ***XR Glasses*** \- Competing with Amazon, Apple's announced glasses and their 'watch', Microsoft, etc.

**Autonomous Driving / UAV Delivery:**

\------***Waymo, Wing*** \- Competing with Tesla (been kicking their ass on it for a while now), GM, and yes, Amazon Air delivery.  *They also just announced another partnership with Walmart to bring more drones to over 100 stores for deliveries!*

**AI in Healthcare / Biotech:**

\------*Verily, & Calico* \- working on aging / genetics and ai in healthcare.

\-*and probably a few others i've missed..*.  but the scope of their work is clear.

\-

When you buy GOOGL you are buying the entirety of Alphabets investments.  And they are so well positioned from a fundamental and financial perspective as seen in this group of charts.  They make double nearly double the revenue of Nvidia...

[Google makes more revenue than the rest of the Mag 7, nearly double Nvidia's earnings!  the only exception of Apple which could be in jeopardy too if they dont continue to innovate.](https://preview.redd.it/i61ok3bywl5f1.png?width=1183&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab383da02f61b9d5fdc7bb71ce2bde6c7d453ac2)

\-

Yet oddly, Google has the lowest P/E (price to earnings) ratio than the rest of the Mag 7!  That seems off if you ask me.  I believe they can take plenty of market share back in the future based on these 2 figures.

https://preview.redd.it/a61jyxhzwl5f1.png?width=1125&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b85188b91cd7b2b6b95516e18513586d86d630b

\-

# -------- Technical Analysis --------

so now lets look at the Chart!  Because Price Action Speaks more than anything else...

I like to use Multiple Timeframes for analysis so here I have the 4 hour, daily, and weekly charts.

I know there are a lot of lines and colors, dont be scared.  The indicators I use are patterns combined with price action, fib levels, TTM squeeze, RSI and some other factors such as price gaps.

\- With RSI, above/below the 50 line tells you if momentum is bullish or bearish.  All the higher timeframes are above that 50 line indicating a potential bullish reversal.

\- With TTM it makes it easier to visualize these momentum shifts.  Right now my focus is on that Weekly chart on the bottom right - higher time frames are usually more important and it appears to be on the verge of a weekly breakout.  Now with a stock like this it could take months to reach that earnings Gap and make a new all time high.  When or If this happens depends on a lot of factors, but I am only focusing on the chart.

\- The Fibonacci Retracements I mostly use for the 50% line to determine if the price has had a change of trend.  Right now the price is attempting a breakout above this retracement and if it can break over 175 then there is plenty of room up.

\- Ive also illustrated some patterns and concepts on the chart.  Inverted Head and Shoulders, Trendline Break, Higher Highs and Higher Lows, potentially an even larger inverted H&S on the daily chart to the top right.

https://preview.redd.it/d2fprue33m5f1.jpg?width=3676&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=77f0a1e390e7b81ec6f893f6f38220ffc3fde21f

Ok so what does this technical analysis mumbo jumbo mean?  Its hard to say because of Trump, Tarrifs, Deals, Interest Rates, Bonds, Geopolitics, the fact that the market has already just about reached all time highs and this is lagging...  it is concerning.  It could also just be setting up for a massive (bearish) head and shoulders as you might notice on the bottom right weekly chart.

But with WWDC, RoboTaxi, and several trump deals supposedly taking place next week, we could be setup for some bullish continuation if these tech events impress.  Either way, Long Term I believe Google / Alphabet stock will get back to 200.

From a technical and fundamental perspective they are in great shape.  I would even bet that if the market pulls back, that institutions may rotate their Mag 7 holdings into the laggards such as this and Amazon.

While they are aggressively competing with so many different companies and industries, their earnings are expected to continue to grow and as you saw earlier, they earn double what Nvidia earns... Pelosi still has calls, and lets face it, you still use some kind of google product in your life whether its youtube, your android based phone, ai / gemini research, waymo, etc...  I believe Google is well positioned to be a winner this year in AI and many of its subsidiary company products.

\--------------

# TLDR:

**Alphabet is a great Bet !**

I currently am selling put credit spreads on GOOGL, and have several 180 calls for 7/18 that I only plan to hold through next week before I re-enter as there is going to be a lot going on next week for the markets.  Their earnings are on 7/22 I believe, so August may be a better strike date.  Shares or LEAPS (calls dated atleast for 2026) are also a good idea IMO, you can sell calls against them to hedge when there are large spikes.

**Anyway, I am highly regarded** ***and this is not financial advice,*** but I am very bullish on Google long term.  Its not an easy one to trade if you like short dated options, you need patience, but the chart, the p/e ratios, the incredible amount of subsidiaries competing with more than other Mag 7 companies makes this thing a highly undervalued growth & value stock.

*Price Target short term - 180*

*Price Target long term - 200+*

CAN,1l4e6mf,Perfectly Timed Tesla Puts (Gain and DD),"Regards Retards,

Gonna try to keep this short.  I am writing this as a Tesla owner (love that car) and former Tesla bull.  I actually bought Tesla shares the day after the election, but then sold them at $385 for the initial $14,659.15 gain.  

When the Doge problems started being apparent, I started buying puts, hit the downslope decently from above $300 to the $240s.  Got out pre earnings to avoid IV crush and because for some reason TSLA always moons on earnings no matter how bad they are.  +\~$32K  
  
Last week, I started to get that itch again thinking, man TSLA is gonna go down again...didn't have any position...was thinking about it.  Then, as soon as Elon walked into the Oval Office with that black eye, I was literally tripping all over myself on both the phone and CPU to buy puts.  I think I got in at about 360 - 355 for the 7/11 dated puts, but TSLA was dropping fast as I was buying those.    
  
Then there was today, which was just amazing.  The stuff that dreams are made of.  Chef's kiss.  
  
Degenernates, it is my hypothesis that this is not over.  Tesla can go much, much, much lower.  Setting aside the ridiculous valuation, declining sales, and toxic brand.  The biggest asset that Tesla had, it's closeness to the Whitehouse, is now its biggest liability.  The US government can hurt TSLA in so many ways:  

* TSLA is operating under numerous Federal and State level permits that can come under scrutiny 
* Just yesterday, I watched a video of an FSD Tesla tragically unalive a pedestrian, might the company face criminal liability? (BTW they should call it F\*\*king Scary Driving, I've tried it out, no way am I getting in a Robotaxi) 
* Elon Musk has regularly done things (tweeting, self-dealing) that could warrant SEC investigations 
* Elon Musk could easily be picked up on drug charges

Anyway, I wanted to get this out in case anyone is still holding: **Sell. Right now.** After-hours, pre-market, doesn’t matter — just sell.  Some bigger fool will still give you 280, but only today.  There is no reason for a bounce. The meme lords will not ride in to save you. Don’t let sunk cost fallacy wipe you out.  There is no floor here.

The backtest is simple— If a company drops by 50%, we invest $100 in that company and then hold.

I immediately ran into an issue. Out of the 502 companies on the list, 262 companies experienced a drawdown of more than 50% over the last 10 years. If you end up investing in all of them, your average return will be comparable to the index since you are holding half the index. *(Average return of 114% for the drawdown portfolio vs. 123% for the S&P 500).*

**Where it gets interesting is when we increase the drawdown cutoffs.**

# Drawdown cutoff — 75%

* Number of stocks: 91
* Total amount of investment: $9,500
* Drawdown portfolio final value (June’25): $23,903 **(151% return)**
* Comparable S&P 500 index: $20,467 **(115% return)**
* Alpha — 36%
* Median return: 68.4%

# Best and worst performers

As you would expect, investing in companies that had significant drawdowns would be highly volatile. After all, a stock that went down 90% can again go down another 90%!

Buy and hold seems to be the best strategy, as there would be many multi-baggers..

BE,1l7ij81,Top Golf and Callaway spinoff,"$MODG — Upcoming Spinoff Could Be the Launchpad. Don’t Sleep on This One.

Alright degenerates, hear me out.

$MODG (Topgolf Callaway Brands) is about to do something that very few are paying attention to — they’re spinning off their equipment division into a separate public company. This isn’t just corporate fluff — this is potentially rocket fuel.

Here’s why you should care:

Topgolf is the crown jewel – MODG owns Topgolf, which is basically the Dave & Buster’s of golf. Growing like crazy, expanding globally, and pulling in a younger demo. High margin, high growth, and borderline addictive for millennials and Zoomers.

The spinoff = multiple expansion – Wall Street loves a “pure play.” By splitting the slower, legacy equipment biz (Callaway clubs, balls, etc.) into its own entity, you free Topgolf from the drag. Investors can finally value Topgolf like a modern experiential brand, not a golf bag company.

Hidden value about to unlock – Analysts have consistently undervalued the company due to its blended structure. Post-spinoff, don’t be surprised if institutions jump in with fresh eyes and new models. It’s not a stretch to see this re-rated hard.

Add in the fact that the spinoff is expected to finalize in Q3 2025, and we’re looking at a classic “buy before the break” setup.

What am I missing here? Anyone else loading up pre-split or playing it through options?

Let’s talk — bullish case, bear case, or your favorite play structure. But either way, this might be the last chance to get in before this thing tees off.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1l7ij81/top_golf_and_callaway_spinoff/,1749508116.0,0,71,wallstreetbets

BE,1l736uz,Why Sweetgreen Is Undervalued,"So here’s my honest take on why I think Sweetgreen is undervalued compared to where it’s heading in the future. For some context, I’ve been slowly accumulating shares since February 21st, 2023, with my first buy being 106 shares at $9.38. I currently hold 3,194.055 shares at an average cost of $23.66—which is about $9.61 higher than where the stock is trading today.

Anyway, here’s what I think is going right for Sweetgreen right now, and what’s not going so great:


What’s Going Well

1. Rewards Program Rolling Out Nicely
They just launched a new rewards program that gives 10 points for every $1 spent—and they’re signing up 20,000 new members a week. This is huge because it’ll let them target offers by customer segment and even individually, which is something that’s worked really well for other fast-casual chains to drive better same-store sales and revenue growth.

2. Infinite Kitchen Expansion = Big Efficiency Gains
They’re on track to open 40 new stores this year, and at least 20 of those will be the new Infinite Kitchen format. Plus, they’ll be opening their first Infinite Kitchen with a drive-thru, which could be a big deal down the road—drive-thrus are super competitive but also super profitable if you do them right.

The Infinite Kitchen is already showing big improvements—like around 700 basis points in margin boost mostly from labor savings, plus a potential 100 basis point COGS improvement. That’s at least 7 percentage points from labor and 1 point from COGS compared to similar stores without the tech.

The first Infinite Kitchen store hit a 26% restaurant-level margin in its first full month—that’s way better than the 20.4% average across the chain at the time. Less staff, more accuracy, faster service. Huge win.

3. Right Target Customer
Millennials and Gen Z are their core customer base—which is perfect because these groups really care about health, sustainability, transparency… everything Sweetgreen leans into. Together they make up like 43% of the U.S. population. Long-term this is the group you want.

4. Revenue Still Growing Despite Everything
Even with all the macro headwinds, fires in California (where a lot of their stores are), reduced marketing, and seasonal menu pullbacks, they’re still growing revenue at over 15% year-over-year. That’s not bad considering everything going on.


Valuation is Dirt Cheap Compared to Peers…

Here’s the kicker no one seems to be talking about—Sweetgreen is dirt cheap compared to the comps.

Right now they trade at a 2.1x EV/FY 2025 revenue multiple. That’s less than half of Chipotle’s valuation, and below Cava and even McDonald’s—who’s also struggling to grow same-store sales right now.

Their guidance says they’ll end FY 2025 with 286 stores (adding 40 this year), which puts their valuation at around $5.5 million EV per store. Chipotle is sitting at $16.2 million EV per store (with over 4,000 stores expected by year-end).

So yeah—Sweetgreen stores are underperforming right now. But the top-line pressure is mostly macro-related (stuff that should pass) and the margin squeeze should ease as they roll out more Infinite Kitchens.

For long-term investors willing to wait this out, this is a super cheap stock on both a revenue and per-store basis.


What’s Not Going So Well

1. Same-Store Sales Took a Hit
Q1 2025 was rough—same-store sales dropped 3.1%, which was the first negative comp since their IPO in 2021. People are spending less on discretionary stuff, and the fast-casual space is super competitive right now.

But I honestly think this is a temporary issue—they’re in a weird transition period with the loyalty program, there were the California wildfires, and they pulled back seasonal menu items. My guess is by the back half of the year, comps will be back on track.

2. Portion Size Complaints = Real Problem
This one is more anecdotal but I’ve spent some time (probably way too much time) digging through social media and reviews—and there’s a common theme: people think portions are small for the price they’re paying. Price per calorie is way worse than competitors and that’s something they really need to fix if they want loyal, repeat customers.

The Infinite Kitchen should help with this since everything is measured perfectly—but honestly I’m surprised these places don’t have like portioning spoons or scales for proteins to make sure staff isn’t shorting people. Seems like such an easy win.

3. Can They Get Loyalty Members to Come Back More Often?
20,000 new signups a week is great—but if those people don’t come back more often, it won’t matter. They need to find a way to get those new members hooked and visiting more frequently. If they do, same-store sales could pop big time.


Why I’m Still Super Bullish

Look, despite all this, I think Sweetgreen has a shot to 10x in the next 5–10 years, which would get them to an $18–20 billion market cap. That’s not crazy when you look at Chipotle sitting at $70B and Cava at $10B.

Plus, they’ve got tons of optionality left—new menu stuff, handheld items, healthy fountain drinks like kombucha (super high margin). This is a company going through a rough patch, but I think they’ll come out the other side way stronger.

BE,1l6rv8n,Verizon looks primed for a big rally.,"I'll keep this short and sweet, but here are the bullet points :

* Technically-speaking, VZ has been consolidating in a Bullish Pennant for weeks, it has reached the end of the pennant and looks poised to breakout. Call option volume has been picking up over this time, and puts have steadily been closing.
* When QQQ falls, people tend to seek safety in stable, high-dividend stocks like VZ (which generates a high 6%+ dividend). 
* Generally-speaking, VZ tends to be quite resilient when the market corrects. Especially when tech falls. If you put the 2 charts together, every time QQQ falls, VZ pumps. QQQ is forming a bearish divergence on the daily chart, and is looking ready to retrace a bit (there is also a gap fill that could occur down a little ways on QQQ, which could further fuel the pump in VZ).
* Most of the volume recently seems to be hedge funds hoarding shares. I've been browsing through the trade history and options flow. The $45 call has 40K+ OI, I've watched OI on that strike alone double over the past week, the stock could get gamma-squeezed. Weekly volume is increasing. Sentiment is 85% bullish. \*weekly chart pictured\*
* If tech stocks take a breather, which IMO it looks like they will this week, I think seeing 1 high volume green candle on VZ daily chart will confirm the breakout.
* Analyst estimates range from $47-55 for the year, I think it could start climbing into that range soon. When VZ rallies, it tends to rally 10-20% over a couple of weeks. Depending on where you measure the pennant pole, the target would be from \~$50-$55.

I think if there is anything that causes people to seek shelter outside of the bond market, which has been struggling lately, VZ is a prime candidate, and from a technical analysis perspective, it looks primed to rally hard.

Do what you will with this information. Godspeed regards!

BE,1l628m7,why GOOGL (Alphabet) is a great buy right now,"With WWDC and the Robotaxi event next week, I'd like to discuss Google and its parent company Alphabet, they have been in trouble for a while now regarding some bullshit anti-trust cases, and I want to tell you why its pure FUD.  Google has really caught up with the rest of the Mag 7 giants in their AI advancements if you haven't noticed.  They have been doing AI machine learning since 2001.  Bard was unimpressive, but that was only little over a year ago.  The speed at which they have been making new advancements is almost hard to track (even across other LLM's).

Have you tried Gemini?  VEO 3 costs 250/m and people are loving it. (the rev. from that will be great as well) and the new AI mode for search seems to finally have been embraced and I think they can actually leverage AI to better serve people the right business ads / referrals.  ***Either way they are monetizing AI***\*...\*

Regarding all the FUD, I dont believe the judge can make them sell chrome, EU case is just stupid, the whole thing is about them having monopoly on search and ads...  well there is Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo, Perplexity, Meta / Instagram business Ads, etc..  they have no monopoly anymore if there was one...

I dont believe the cases will result in anything materially bad for the stock but nobody can be sure, so that is why I want to dig into the Fundmental and Technical Analysis.

# ----------- Fundamentals -----------

Alphabet is a massive conglomerate with many subsidiaries.  Lets talk about how they are competing and kicking ass in so many different industries.

\-

**AI:**  

*VEO 3, AI Mode, Gemini, DeepMind* \- Competing with GPT pro, Microsoft, etc.  (note VEO 3 is still the only model that does text to video PLUS audio.  I think they leveraged youtube for it.

**Data Centers / Internet Provider:**

\-----*Google Cloud, TPU's, Google Fiber* \-Competing with many, but their TPU's are very good for AI data centers, and google Fiber competes with internet / service providers like AT&T / Comcast / T-Mobile, etc..

**Quantum Computing:**

\------Competing with Microsoft, IBM, Rigetti, etc.

**Smart Phones:**

\------*Android, Pixel Phone* (with Gemini that kicks Siri's ass) - competing with Apple big-time

**Streaming / Ads:**

\------*Youtube & Google Ads* \- Competing with Meta and Netflix

**Smart Home / Wearables:**

\------*Nest, Fitbit,* & ***XR Glasses*** \- Competing with Amazon, Apple's announced glasses and their 'watch', Microsoft, etc.

**Autonomous Driving / UAV Delivery:**

\------***Waymo, Wing*** \- Competing with Tesla (been kicking their ass on it for a while now), GM, and yes, Amazon Air delivery.  *They also just announced another partnership with Walmart to bring more drones to over 100 stores for deliveries!*

**AI in Healthcare / Biotech:**

\------*Verily, & Calico* \- working on aging / genetics and ai in healthcare.

\-*and probably a few others i've missed..*.  but the scope of their work is clear.

\-

When you buy GOOGL you are buying the entirety of Alphabets investments.  And they are so well positioned from a fundamental and financial perspective as seen in this group of charts.  They make double nearly double the revenue of Nvidia...

[Google makes more revenue than the rest of the Mag 7, nearly double Nvidia's earnings!  the only exception of Apple which could be in jeopardy too if they dont continue to innovate.](https://preview.redd.it/i61ok3bywl5f1.png?width=1183&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab383da02f61b9d5fdc7bb71ce2bde6c7d453ac2)

\-

Yet oddly, Google has the lowest P/E (price to earnings) ratio than the rest of the Mag 7!  That seems off if you ask me.  I believe they can take plenty of market share back in the future based on these 2 figures.

https://preview.redd.it/a61jyxhzwl5f1.png?width=1125&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b85188b91cd7b2b6b95516e18513586d86d630b

\-

# -------- Technical Analysis --------

so now lets look at the Chart!  Because Price Action Speaks more than anything else...

I like to use Multiple Timeframes for analysis so here I have the 4 hour, daily, and weekly charts.

I know there are a lot of lines and colors, dont be scared.  The indicators I use are patterns combined with price action, fib levels, TTM squeeze, RSI and some other factors such as price gaps.

\- With RSI, above/below the 50 line tells you if momentum is bullish or bearish.  All the higher timeframes are above that 50 line indicating a potential bullish reversal.

\- With TTM it makes it easier to visualize these momentum shifts.  Right now my focus is on that Weekly chart on the bottom right - higher time frames are usually more important and it appears to be on the verge of a weekly breakout.  Now with a stock like this it could take months to reach that earnings Gap and make a new all time high.  When or If this happens depends on a lot of factors, but I am only focusing on the chart.

\- The Fibonacci Retracements I mostly use for the 50% line to determine if the price has had a change of trend.  Right now the price is attempting a breakout above this retracement and if it can break over 175 then there is plenty of room up.

\- Ive also illustrated some patterns and concepts on the chart.  Inverted Head and Shoulders, Trendline Break, Higher Highs and Higher Lows, potentially an even larger inverted H&S on the daily chart to the top right.

https://preview.redd.it/d2fprue33m5f1.jpg?width=3676&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=77f0a1e390e7b81ec6f893f6f38220ffc3fde21f

Ok so what does this technical analysis mumbo jumbo mean?  Its hard to say because of Trump, Tarrifs, Deals, Interest Rates, Bonds, Geopolitics, the fact that the market has already just about reached all time highs and this is lagging...  it is concerning.  It could also just be setting up for a massive (bearish) head and shoulders as you might notice on the bottom right weekly chart.

But with WWDC, RoboTaxi, and several trump deals supposedly taking place next week, we could be setup for some bullish continuation if these tech events impress.  Either way, Long Term I believe Google / Alphabet stock will get back to 200.

From a technical and fundamental perspective they are in great shape.  I would even bet that if the market pulls back, that institutions may rotate their Mag 7 holdings into the laggards such as this and Amazon.

While they are aggressively competing with so many different companies and industries, their earnings are expected to continue to grow and as you saw earlier, they earn double what Nvidia earns... Pelosi still has calls, and lets face it, you still use some kind of google product in your life whether its youtube, your android based phone, ai / gemini research, waymo, etc...  I believe Google is well positioned to be a winner this year in AI and many of its subsidiary company products.

\--------------

# TLDR:

**Alphabet is a great Bet !**

I currently am selling put credit spreads on GOOGL, and have several 180 calls for 7/18 that I only plan to hold through next week before I re-enter as there is going to be a lot going on next week for the markets.  Their earnings are on 7/22 I believe, so August may be a better strike date.  Shares or LEAPS (calls dated atleast for 2026) are also a good idea IMO, you can sell calls against them to hedge when there are large spikes.

**Anyway, I am highly regarded** ***and this is not financial advice,*** but I am very bullish on Google long term.  Its not an easy one to trade if you like short dated options, you need patience, but the chart, the p/e ratios, the incredible amount of subsidiaries competing with more than other Mag 7 companies makes this thing a highly undervalued growth & value stock.

*Price Target short term - 180*

*Price Target long term - 200+*

Millennials and Gen Z are their core customer base—which is perfect because these groups really care about health, sustainability, transparency… everything Sweetgreen leans into. Together they make up like 43% of the U.S. population. Long-term this is the group you want.

4. Revenue Still Growing Despite Everything
Even with all the macro headwinds, fires in California (where a lot of their stores are), reduced marketing, and seasonal menu pullbacks, they’re still growing revenue at over 15% year-over-year. That’s not bad considering everything going on.


Valuation is Dirt Cheap Compared to Peers…

Here’s the kicker no one seems to be talking about—Sweetgreen is dirt cheap compared to the comps.

Right now they trade at a 2.1x EV/FY 2025 revenue multiple. That’s less than half of Chipotle’s valuation, and below Cava and even McDonald’s—who’s also struggling to grow same-store sales right now.

Their guidance says they’ll end FY 2025 with 286 stores (adding 40 this year), which puts their valuation at around $5.5 million EV per store. Chipotle is sitting at $16.2 million EV per store (with over 4,000 stores expected by year-end).

So yeah—Sweetgreen stores are underperforming right now. But the top-line pressure is mostly macro-related (stuff that should pass) and the margin squeeze should ease as they roll out more Infinite Kitchens.

For long-term investors willing to wait this out, this is a super cheap stock on both a revenue and per-store basis.


What’s Not Going So Well

1. Same-Store Sales Took a Hit
Q1 2025 was rough—same-store sales dropped 3.1%, which was the first negative comp since their IPO in 2021. People are spending less on discretionary stuff, and the fast-casual space is super competitive right now.

But I honestly think this is a temporary issue—they’re in a weird transition period with the loyalty program, there were the California wildfires, and they pulled back seasonal menu items. My guess is by the back half of the year, comps will be back on track.

2. Portion Size Complaints = Real Problem
This one is more anecdotal but I’ve spent some time (probably way too much time) digging through social media and reviews—and there’s a common theme: people think portions are small for the price they’re paying. Price per calorie is way worse than competitors and that’s something they really need to fix if they want loyal, repeat customers.

The Infinite Kitchen should help with this since everything is measured perfectly—but honestly I’m surprised these places don’t have like portioning spoons or scales for proteins to make sure staff isn’t shorting people. Seems like such an easy win.

3. Can They Get Loyalty Members to Come Back More Often?
20,000 new signups a week is great—but if those people don’t come back more often, it won’t matter. They need to find a way to get those new members hooked and visiting more frequently. If they do, same-store sales could pop big time.


Why I’m Still Super Bullish

Look, despite all this, I think Sweetgreen has a shot to 10x in the next 5–10 years, which would get them to an $18–20 billion market cap. That’s not crazy when you look at Chipotle sitting at $70B and Cava at $10B.

Plus, they’ve got tons of optionality left—new menu stuff, handheld items, healthy fountain drinks like kombucha (super high margin). This is a company going through a rough patch, but I think they’ll come out the other side way stronger.

M,1l628m7,why GOOGL (Alphabet) is a great buy right now,"With WWDC and the Robotaxi event next week, I'd like to discuss Google and its parent company Alphabet, they have been in trouble for a while now regarding some bullshit anti-trust cases, and I want to tell you why its pure FUD.  Google has really caught up with the rest of the Mag 7 giants in their AI advancements if you haven't noticed.  They have been doing AI machine learning since 2001.  Bard was unimpressive, but that was only little over a year ago.  The speed at which they have been making new advancements is almost hard to track (even across other LLM's).

Have you tried Gemini?  VEO 3 costs 250/m and people are loving it. (the rev. from that will be great as well) and the new AI mode for search seems to finally have been embraced and I think they can actually leverage AI to better serve people the right business ads / referrals.  ***Either way they are monetizing AI***\*...\*

Regarding all the FUD, I dont believe the judge can make them sell chrome, EU case is just stupid, the whole thing is about them having monopoly on search and ads...  well there is Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo, Perplexity, Meta / Instagram business Ads, etc..  they have no monopoly anymore if there was one...

I dont believe the cases will result in anything materially bad for the stock but nobody can be sure, so that is why I want to dig into the Fundmental and Technical Analysis.

# ----------- Fundamentals -----------

Alphabet is a massive conglomerate with many subsidiaries.  Lets talk about how they are competing and kicking ass in so many different industries.

\-

**AI:**  

*VEO 3, AI Mode, Gemini, DeepMind* \- Competing with GPT pro, Microsoft, etc.  (note VEO 3 is still the only model that does text to video PLUS audio.  I think they leveraged youtube for it.

**Data Centers / Internet Provider:**

\-----*Google Cloud, TPU's, Google Fiber* \-Competing with many, but their TPU's are very good for AI data centers, and google Fiber competes with internet / service providers like AT&T / Comcast / T-Mobile, etc..

**Quantum Computing:**

\------Competing with Microsoft, IBM, Rigetti, etc.

**Smart Phones:**

\------*Android, Pixel Phone* (with Gemini that kicks Siri's ass) - competing with Apple big-time

**Streaming / Ads:**

\------*Youtube & Google Ads* \- Competing with Meta and Netflix

**Smart Home / Wearables:**

\------*Nest, Fitbit,* & ***XR Glasses*** \- Competing with Amazon, Apple's announced glasses and their 'watch', Microsoft, etc.

**Autonomous Driving / UAV Delivery:**

\------***Waymo, Wing*** \- Competing with Tesla (been kicking their ass on it for a while now), GM, and yes, Amazon Air delivery.  *They also just announced another partnership with Walmart to bring more drones to over 100 stores for deliveries!*

**AI in Healthcare / Biotech:**

\------*Verily, & Calico* \- working on aging / genetics and ai in healthcare.

\-*and probably a few others i've missed..*.  but the scope of their work is clear.

\-

When you buy GOOGL you are buying the entirety of Alphabets investments.  And they are so well positioned from a fundamental and financial perspective as seen in this group of charts.  They make double nearly double the revenue of Nvidia...

[Google makes more revenue than the rest of the Mag 7, nearly double Nvidia's earnings!  the only exception of Apple which could be in jeopardy too if they dont continue to innovate.](https://preview.redd.it/i61ok3bywl5f1.png?width=1183&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab383da02f61b9d5fdc7bb71ce2bde6c7d453ac2)

\-

Yet oddly, Google has the lowest P/E (price to earnings) ratio than the rest of the Mag 7!  That seems off if you ask me.  I believe they can take plenty of market share back in the future based on these 2 figures.

# -------- Technical Analysis --------

so now lets look at the Chart!  Because Price Action Speaks more than anything else...

I like to use Multiple Timeframes for analysis so here I have the 4 hour, daily, and weekly charts.

I know there are a lot of lines and colors, dont be scared.  The indicators I use are patterns combined with price action, fib levels, TTM squeeze, RSI and some other factors such as price gaps.

\- With RSI, above/below the 50 line tells you if momentum is bullish or bearish.  All the higher timeframes are above that 50 line indicating a potential bullish reversal.

\- With TTM it makes it easier to visualize these momentum shifts.  Right now my focus is on that Weekly chart on the bottom right - higher time frames are usually more important and it appears to be on the verge of a weekly breakout.  Now with a stock like this it could take months to reach that earnings Gap and make a new all time high.  When or If this happens depends on a lot of factors, but I am only focusing on the chart.

\- The Fibonacci Retracements I mostly use for the 50% line to determine if the price has had a change of trend.  Right now the price is attempting a breakout above this retracement and if it can break over 175 then there is plenty of room up.

\- Ive also illustrated some patterns and concepts on the chart.  Inverted Head and Shoulders, Trendline Break, Higher Highs and Higher Lows, potentially an even larger inverted H&S on the daily chart to the top right.

https://preview.redd.it/d2fprue33m5f1.jpg?width=3676&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=77f0a1e390e7b81ec6f893f6f38220ffc3fde21f

Ok so what does this technical analysis mumbo jumbo mean?  Its hard to say because of Trump, Tarrifs, Deals, Interest Rates, Bonds, Geopolitics, the fact that the market has already just about reached all time highs and this is lagging...  it is concerning.  It could also just be setting up for a massive (bearish) head and shoulders as you might notice on the bottom right weekly chart.

But with WWDC, RoboTaxi, and several trump deals supposedly taking place next week, we could be setup for some bullish continuation if these tech events impress.  Either way, Long Term I believe Google / Alphabet stock will get back to 200.

From a technical and fundamental perspective they are in great shape.  I would even bet that if the market pulls back, that institutions may rotate their Mag 7 holdings into the laggards such as this and Amazon.

While they are aggressively competing with so many different companies and industries, their earnings are expected to continue to grow and as you saw earlier, they earn double what Nvidia earns... Pelosi still has calls, and lets face it, you still use some kind of google product in your life whether its youtube, your android based phone, ai / gemini research, waymo, etc...  I believe Google is well positioned to be a winner this year in AI and many of its subsidiary company products.

\--------------

# TLDR:

**Alphabet is a great Bet !**

I currently am selling put credit spreads on GOOGL, and have several 180 calls for 7/18 that I only plan to hold through next week before I re-enter as there is going to be a lot going on next week for the markets.  Their earnings are on 7/22 I believe, so August may be a better strike date.  Shares or LEAPS (calls dated atleast for 2026) are also a good idea IMO, you can sell calls against them to hedge when there are large spikes.

**Anyway, I am highly regarded** ***and this is not financial advice,*** but I am very bullish on Google long term.  Its not an easy one to trade if you like short dated options, you need patience, but the chart, the p/e ratios, the incredible amount of subsidiaries competing with more than other Mag 7 companies makes this thing a highly undervalued growth & value stock.

*Price Target short term - 180*

*Price Target long term - 200+*
